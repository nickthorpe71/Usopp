Zoah," WELCOME, GHOST-BOY! ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE ME?"
Zoah, HIIIYAAAAAAH!!!
Harle," Serge, mon ami! Your humain world iz about to end!"
Harle," At zat time, zere shall be enmity between you and ze world."
Harle, Zis iz not prophétie nor spéculation! 'Tiz histoire!
Kid, Oi! C'mon Serge
Kid," Just you wait, Lynx! Today's gonna be the day of reckonin'!!! Say yer prayers! ...Not that it'll do ya any good!!!"
Kid, Heh-heh-heh...... HA-HA-HA-HA-HAAA!
Kid, Some kinda switch? Bugger! So close and yet so far...
Kid, Oi! What the bloody hell just happened?
Kid, What are we doin' out here?
Kid, Wooooow! Bugger...!!! We're so high up! Is this thing floatin'!?
Kid," This sure is some fort... Eh, Serge?"
Kid," You alright, mate? You've been actin' all weird. Who knows what's up ahead, so just stay on yer toes, eh!?"
Poshul, AHHH! I-I-Ith that... a Heckran bone!?
Poshul, Serge!? A p-p-prethent!? F-F-For I!?
Poshul," How'd you know? Hmm... To acthept, or not to acthept?"
Poshul, AHEM! Me acthept your prethent and Me shall help you!
Poshul," Me will do anything you want. Me will be honored to be by your thide! Me will use my Pretty- Miracle-Power-X! Me will do it, Serge!!!"
Radius," Hmm? What do you have there? Oh? Is this what all the young 'uns are crazy about these days? Hoh-hoh-hoh! That is great! Back in my day, we used to collect Heckran fangs. I guess every generation has its favorites, and I guess we play alike, too."
Radius," Oh, Serge, how goes it? How would you like to join everyone for my lecture? Today's lecture is 'The Fundamentals of Attack and the Art of Elements.'"
Radius, How about it? Would you like to join my lecture? Today's lecture is 'The Fundamentals of Attack and the Art of Elements.' ~~~Sure ~~~Maybe next time
Radius," Excellent! A true man, you are. Well then, let's get on with it."
Radius," ......! You're way too advanced for my lecture! Keep up the good work, sonny."
Poshul, Then Me will watch from here. Good ruck!
Radius," Pooped already, eh? And you're still so young... Oh well, don't let it get you down. Come again anytime, sonny."
Radius," Well now, did you find it helpful? Come again, sonny. I promise to take it easy on you!"
Radius," You've learned well, sonny. You'll do just fine."
Radius," Oh? It does not interest you? Oh well... Come again, sonny. I promise to take it easy on you!"
Radius, Hoh-hoh-hoh...
Radius," First, here's some basic advice on attacking, so listen up young'un...! You know that the three different attack levels -- Weak, Strong, and Fierce -- each have differing accuracy, or \'\HIT%\'\ values, don't you? Every time you hit your opponent, each of these values increase to make it easier for your next attack to hit its mark! A good strategy is to start with Weak(1) blows, which have the highest chance of succeeding, and then build up to Strong(2) and Fierce(3) blows. So, rather than attacking willy-nilly, you should aim to build up your HIT%. If your Fierce(3) attacks don't hit home, you're just wasting your energy! Weak! Strong!! Fierce!!!"
Radius," Hoh-hoh-hoh! You're not even close! Don't be trusting in your HIT% too much there, boy! As long as it's not 100%, you still run the risk of missing continuously, don't you!? Sometimes it pays to muster up the courage to use Strong(2) and Fierce(3) attacks straight from the start, too! Fierce! Fierce!!"
Radius," Next, let's check out the use of Elements! When you use an Element, the color of that Element's attribute remains on the battlefield in the form of the \'\Field Effect!\'\ Each time you consecutively use the same-colored Elements, the effectiveness of that colored Element group increases! Here, I'll show you... Let's fill up all the Field Effect attributes with the color blue! Try using a blue Element after me..."
Radius, See! The field is completely blue now. Any blue Elements you use now will sure pack a punch! Here! Try this out...
Radius," Hey there! Hurry up and turn all the Field Effect attributes blue, for crying out loud! Don't you know how to use them Elements or something, young'un? If that's the case, then listen up, boy! It takes some explaining!"
Radius," First, you've got to choose \'\Attack\'\ to do some physical damage to your opponent in order to get started! Weak(1), Strong(2), and Fierce(3) attacks each add 1, 2, or 3 points to your Element Power Level. Your current level is the number that appears above the \'\Lv\'\ symbol under your name there, son! Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you! You won't accumulate any power unless you actually succeed in hitting your opponent... So be careful! You can't afford to miss!"
Radius," Discharging this accumulated power is what using Elements is all about! Once you've built up some power, you will be able to choose the \'\Element\'\ option from the battle menu. When you select the Element option, gray-colored rectangular plates appear on the screen, don't they? Those plates are the Elements you currently have allocated."
Radius," So...why don't you try using one of those blue Elements you have there, boy? Relax! They won't disappear when you use them... You just won't be able to use them again for the rest of this battle, that's all! Once you enter another battle, you'll be able to use them again. So don't hold back now... But even though I say this, I still have to stress that you've got to consider the appropriate time to use your Elements. Otherwise, you'll never be able to beat some of the harder enemies you're bound to meet! You've got to form the proper strategy, boy!"
Radius," Oh, but wait! I'm forgetting something important... (It must be my old age!) There are some Elements that disappear in a puff of smoke each time you use them! The Element \'\Tablet\'\ is just one example! These are called \'\Consumable Elements,\'\ and they have the symbol \'\\Object\\'\ in front of their names. These don't regenerate after each battle. However, the benefit of such Consumable Elements is that you can allocate up to five of these into the same Element Grid space. Doing so allows you to use several of them in the same battle, unlike Basic Elements, which normally can only be used once in any one battle. That is why Consumable Elements also have a number such as \'\x5\'\ after their names. That's the number you currently hold in that Grid position. This number will decrease as the Elements are used up for good. However, after each battle, you can restock more for use next time."
Radius," Anyway, enough about that. More about actually using Elements... I'm sure you'll notice that each time you use an Element, your Element Power Level (as shown by the \'\Lv\'\ number) will go down. It's just simple subtraction, really! For instance, say you're currently at \'\Lv 3\'\ and you decide to use a \Tablet\'\ Element allocated at \Lv 1\ in your Element Grid! In this case 3 minus 1 leaves 2. So your current Element Power Level will now be changed to \'\Lv 2\'\! You can use Elements anytime, so long as your Stamina value is above 1.0. So in this case, you'll still be able to use Elements with a Power Level of up to Lv 2 right after using the Tablet Element!"
Radius," Did you get the gist of it, sonny? Now do you see the importance of developing good battle tactics? You could build up a little power, then use an Element, build up a little more power, then use another Element... repeating this over and over. That's OK! Or you can build up your Element Power to its maximum level and unleash a barrage of Elements, one after another. That's no problem either! Use whatever strategy you think will work to defeat each of the enemies you come across. It's up to you. There are hordes of monsters out there that you'll never be able to defeat by physical attacks alone! You're going to need to master Elements to get by, boy. Well, sorry for the long lecture there, sonny. My explanation about Elements is officially over... Why don't you try and use one now?"
Radius," What's this? You still haven't managed to fill all the Field Effect attributes blue yet? What, you expect an old man to do everything for you? You slacker! Anyway, here we go..."
Radius," Hoh-hoh-hoh! Was that too much for you? Sorry about that, young'un! Conversely, when there is a lot of blue in the Field Effect attributes, the Elements of the opposite color, red, will be weakened! So try to discern your enemy's attack pattern and fill the Field with the opposite color of his attacks as a form of defense. This strategy of using Elements is sure to come in handy, so put it to good use, sonny!"
Radius," Hoh-hoh-hoh... How was that? You learn something there, boy? Anyway, I guess it's time to bring this lesson to an end. Here you go... Hah!"
Kid, Yippieee!!!
Leena," You're late, Serge. Sleeping in as usual, I suppose? You promised you'd go get some Komodo dragon scales for my necklace, remember? Since you were late, my mom asked me to baby-sit the kids!"
Kid," Whoo-hoo! Sergey, Leena, look at me! C'mon, you guys should join us! It feels really good!"
Leena," Unlike the rest of you, we're not here to play! Don't swim out too far, now!"
Kid, Ooookay! Gotcha!
Leena," Kids sure have it easy... Remember when we were like that? Not a single care or worry on our minds... How each day lasted an eternity, filled with newness, fun and excitement..."
Leena, But the important thing now is not our childhood but my Komodo-scale necklace!!! YES! We have to face up to reality and live each day anew!!!
Leena," So, I want you to go to Lizard Rock and get some scales for me! I would join you, but I still have to watch the kids... It's your fault you were late! Once you collect some Komodo dragon scales, I'll catch up with you at Opassa Beach."
Leena," Is that OK with you, Serge? ~~~Sure, no problem! ~~~Nah, forget it..."
Leena," Good! That's what I wanted to hear! OK, then! Don't just stand around! Go collect some scales at Lizard Rock. Let's see... I think 3 should be enough. Good luck, Serge! I'm counting on you!"
Leena," EXCUSE ME!? What did you just say? Hm? Serge!? Think about it! It's your fault for sleeping in, you know! Seeing as how you let me down, I'd say you owe me a couple hundred of those scales! Now go! Go to Lizard Rock and get some scales for me! I'll let you off easy this time with only 3 scales. I'm counting on you, Serge. Good luck, OK?"
Leena," Once you get the scales, wait for me at Opassa Beach. It's just a bit south of Lizard Rock. I'll come by as soon as I'm done baby-sitting!"
Leena," Come on, Serge! Get your butt over to Lizard Rock, already. I think I really deserve about a hundred scales, but I guess 3 will do for now. Once you get all 3 scales, wait for me at Opassa Beach. You know, it's south of Lizard Rock. And...I'll only accept scales that YOU personally collect. I don't want any that were just handed to you."
Leena, ......?
Leena," H-Hey...! Is that a Komodo dragon scale!? Where'd you get it? Someone gave it to you? No, no, that won't do. I don't want it if someone just handed it to you. You need to go out and get them on your own, OK, Serge? No cheating now!"
Leena," Oh? What is it? Nah-uh, Serge. That doesn't interest me one bit! Oh... Don't tell me you forgot about the promise you made."
Leena, Oh? What is it? So...?
Leena," Oh? What is it? Nah-uh, Serge. That doesn't interest me one bit! You promised to get me some Komodo dragon scales, remember!?"
Leena," H-Hey......! Is that a Komodo dragon scale!? Where'd you get it? Ohh, someone gave it to you? Nah-uh, it's just not the same if YOU don't get it yourself."
Man," Along with the dwarves, you'll find other monsters in this forest. I can't just let you wander off by yourself."
Poshul," What are you talking about!? Can't you see that Me, Poshul, ith here!?"
Man," Huh? Oh yeah... I'm sorry, Poshul. I didn't even notice you. Anyway, Poshul won't be of much help, so I suggest you guys head on back to the village."
Poshul, ...... (PO-SHU-SHUUUUU!!!)
System, Serge collected Komodo Scale! He stored it safely away...
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU! We now have 3 Komodo thcales. Ret'th get moving to Opatha Beach and wait for Leena.
System, x button to jump.
Leena, There you are!
Leena," Sorry I'm late. I hope you didn't wait too long, Serge. Poshul? I didn't expect to see you here. So this is where you went off to."
Poshul," Weee! Leena'th here! How are you doing!? Ohhh!!! Are you two on a date? Sowwy, Me think Me should reave you two arone!"
Leena," Oh, pulease! Don't be silly."
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU...!
Leena," Sorry I'm late. I hope you didn't wait too long, Serge."
Leena, It sure has been a long time since we last came here... We used to come all the time.
Leena, Well? How'd it go? Did you get the Komodo dragon scales?
Leena," Oh, they're beautiful! I'll be able to make a great necklace with these."
Leena," Thank you, Serge!"
Leena," And you, too, Poshul!"
Poshul, AHEM! No probrem!
Leena," Thank you, Serge!"
Leena," The sea never changes, does it...? It's been rolling in and out, like this, since long before we were born. It's been here for eternity, it seems... It's probably seen many things... Heard many things... It'll probably keep rolling in and out, in and out, long after our lifetime... Without a single change..."
Leena," Hey, Serge... Remember we used to sit and talk like this when we were kids? With the gentle sea breeze and the tranquil sound of the waves? Just the two of us... Talking..."
Leena, Do you still remember that day? ~~~I don't remember ~~~I remember
Leena," Oh... Then I guess you forgot about the promise we made... Well, I guess it can't be helped. We were so young... On top of that, you almost drowned back then. It was a traumatic time for you."
Leena," Really!? You do...? So, Serge, you haven't forgotten about the promise we made that day!?"
Leena, Hehee...... That makes me... happy.
Leena," But aren't memories strange? Just when you think that you've forgotten about something, it comes floating back into your heart. I guess it's just lying there in wait. Waiting for that right moment..."
Leena," Why, we might even remember this very moment someday! In 10, 20 years...when we're all grown up and married, and have kids of our own... Then one day... When that time comes, I wonder what kind of adults we'll be? What kind of life will I be leading...?"
Leena, I wonder what to make of this day...? ~~~We'll forget it eventually ~~~We'll never forget this day!
Leena, Yeah...... I guess so...... But...... That would be really sad... wouldn't it?
Leena, Yeah... I hope you're right.
Leena," Um, Serge... There's been something I've been wanting to..."
Leena," What? What's wrong, Serge?"
Leena, Serge?
Old Man," What are you doing there, boy? It's dangerous to sleep out here. You alright, boy? What on earth are you doing lying down, anyway? For a second there, I thought you might have been a dead body, washed ashore. Huh? Where's Leena...? You were the only one I saw when I got here. Are you a friend of Leena's? I believe she's in the village, babysitting. Well, I'd best be on my way. Anyway, if you're looking for Leena, you should stop by the village. You know, you shouldn't be playing out here, boy. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you, now."
Poshul," Serge! You're finally up! Thomething went 'whoosh,' and Me wath out cold, too."
Poshul," Me woke up firtht, tho Me went to go rook around. But no thign of Leena anywhere. Do you think Leena thpontaneouthry combuthted? Me wonder if she'th OK?"
Poshul, PO-SHU?
Poshul," The room rookth different... SHU, Serge.? Momma Serge., did you redecorate? It rookth a rittle deprething..."
Poshul," PO-SHU? Rookth rike thith room'th redecorated, too. It kind of rookth rike a junk room... And it'th tho duthty in here..."
Poshul," ......??? Who are you, mithter? Thith ith Serge's houthe, ithn't it? Where ith Momma Serge?"
Poshul," For 5 yearth...? Ith that true, mithter?"
Poshul," PO-SHU!? Thith ith rearry, rearry weird!"
Poshul, Leena! Tho thith ith where you were! How could you jutht reave uth and go back on your own!?
Leena," ...... Go back? On my own? What are you talking about, Poshul?030 And..."
Leena, Who are you? Have we met somewhere before...? Are you from Termina?
Poshul," PO-SHU? What are you thaying, Leena?"
Leena," Don't be silly! Don't go swimming out too far now, you hear!?"
Leena, Kids... I guess kids will be kids...
Leena, Don't worry about them.
Leena, Hmmm... You know... You look a lot like the boy who used to live next door to me... ~~~What was his name...? ~~~What happened to him?
Leena, Why...? Why do you want to know his name?
Leena, What happened to him...? Why do you want to know? It's really none of your business.
Leena, That boy... died...... He drowned... when he was very young... This all happened 10 years ago.
Leena," Soon after, his mother passed away, too... I was still very young back then, so I don't remember too well, but my mom says his name was..."
Leena, ...Serge... ~~~I'm Serge!!! ~~~That's nonsense!!!
Leena," ......!? You're Serge!? Oh, stop that! That's not even funny!!! The boy is dead, don't you understand!?"
Leena, Why would I lie about something like that!? Do you think I'm so cruel as to make something like that up!?
Leena," That boy... I guess I kinda liked him... If that boy were still alive today, I wonder what would've become of us?"
Leena," Sure is weird... Why am I opening up to you like this? Well, I guess there's no use thinking about the past. It's not like Serge is going to come back... Mom always tells me I shouldn't dwell on a lost loved one..."
Leena," ...... You can find his grave up on Cape Howl. Actually, why don't you go visit the grave site? No one's been up there in a while... Well, I still have some chores to finish. Sorry I blew up at you like that."
Leena, Good-bye... stranger.
Leena," You'll find the boy's grave up on Cape Howl... It'd be great if you could visit it.030 I'm sure Serge would be happy, too..."
Leena, Is that... a Komodo dragon scale!? EeeeeeeK! That's disgusting! Get that away from me!
Leena, Hmm? What is it?
Karsh," So you must be Serge... The ghost of the boy who died 10 years ago. Sorry, junior, but we have no business with your friends. We're just after you... Be a good boy and come with us."
Karsh," That doesn't matter! We found the boy here, just as 'he' said we would, didn't we?"
Karsh, Now seize him!
Kid, Hold yer sea horses!!!
Karsh, Who the...?
Karsh," Outta the way, missy! You don't wanna get hurt, now, do you?"
Kid, Shut yer trap! You're the ones who'd betta get outta the way.
Karsh, That's enough!!!
Karsh," Listen up, junior! Our orders are to take you in."
Karsh, We don't wanna hurt you. Just come with us.
Karsh, Or else... this axe o' mine will have to do the talkin'.
Girl, For cryin' out loud... Would ya just shut up and get on with it...! I'm gonna kick yer sorry arses so hard you'll kiss the moons!
Karsh," Fair enough... You leave us no choice. You'll regret this, missy!"
Solt, Sir! His innately INNATE Element color attribute is... ~~~~WHITE!~~~~
Karsh," Right! That does it...! Quick, attack him with the opposite Element attribute color... ~~~~BLACK!~~~~"
Solt," How unfortunately unfortunate! I do not seem to have any, Sir!"
Karsh, You nincompoop! You should always carry Elements of every color! Then how about you there...?
Peppor," I'm shakin' in my shoes to tell you this, Sir, but I don't have any either! We'll have to let you, Sir Karsh, show us how it's done..."
Karsh, !? Useless fools! Errh...... Real men don't need magic when they can fight with their might!
Solt, ...It's no use. There's no escape that way. All you have to do is come with us.
Peppor, Don't move!!!
Karsh, I wouldn't resist if I were you. Take a look behind you... There's nowhere to run!
Girl, Oi! ...The hell you doin'!? These blokes are tryin' to make off with ya!
Girl," Are you just gonna do as you're told!? What are you thinkin'!? Get with the program, mate! ~~~Hold on a second ~~~Alright, I'll fight"
Karsh, Maybe my axe will beat some sense into you!
Girl," Yeah, yeah... You're just all talk! Now, C'MON!"
Peppor," S-Sir Karsh! I say we shake it on outta here, so that we can live to fight another day! Th-These aren't no ordinary brats we're dealing with...!"
Karsh, Damn cowards!
Karsh," As for you, missy...! We won't forget this!"
Girl," Oooh, I'm sooo scaaared! I'll be happy to take you on, anytime! Think I'll lose to scum like you!? Hah!"
Girl," You alright, mate?"
Girl," Serge... Your name's Serge, ain't it?"
Girl, ......
Girl," Oh, me? My name's..."
Kid, Call me 'Kid.' Nice to meet ya.
Kid, I just couldn't stand by and watch those blokes gang up on you like that. They just pissed the bloody hell outta me. I wish I could've beat 'em up some more!
Kid, But why was that mob after ya?
Kid," Whaddaya mean you've never even met 'em before? Eh? Ahhh, forget it."
Kid," Hey, Serge....! How about you and me team up for a while? That Karsh fella ain't gonna just leave you alone, that's for sure!"
Kid," And to tell ya the truth, I'm new to these islands... It's pretty lonely travelin' around here on me own. Hehehe..."
Kid," So, how 'bout it, Serge? Perhaps it was fate that we would meet up like this! ~~~Travel together ~~~Refuse..."
Kid," Beauty, mate! That decides it then! We're real good mates now!"
Kid," Anyways, it'll be gettin' dark soon. I suggest we head to Arni and shack up for the night!"
Kid," Oh, and Serge. Don't go tryin' any funny stuff just coz I'm cute 'n all!"
Kid, Hang on!
Kid," Are you tellin' me, you're gonna refuse the company of a lonely, vulnerable, sweet little girl? ~~~Fine, let's go ~~~......"
Kid," You sure there, mate? You might live to regret it, ya know!? ~~~Sure, let's go ~~~No, thanks"
Kid," Sheeze! Well, have it your way, mate!"
Kid," Beauty, mate! That decides it then! We're real good mates now!"
Kid," Anyways, it'll be gettin' dark soon. I suggest we head to Arni and shack up for the night!"
Kid, And don't go tryin' any funny stuff just coz I'm cute 'n all!
Kid," Beauty, mate! That decides it, then! We're real good mates now!"
Kid," Anyways, it'll be gettin' dark soon. I suggest we head to Arni and shack up for the night!"
Kid, And don't go tryin' any funny stuff just coz I'm cute 'n all!
Kid, I'll be headin' up north to a town called Termina.
Kid," It'll be gettin' dark pretty soon. I suggest ya go find a place to shack up for the night. Don't want ya to become Heckran bait, now. Hehehe..."
Kid, Well... See ya!
Poshul, It wath terribre... They should be kind to animalth...
Kid," Is this yer grave, mate!?"
Kid, What!? You died 10 years ago?
Kid," Whatever, mate. Look at you. You're as fit as a fiddle!"
Kid," So what exactly happened to ya 10 years ago? You don't remember? ~~~No, I don't ~~~Yes, I do"
Kid," Yeah, I didn't think so. You were just a li'l squirt 10 years ago. Of course you don't remember. Oh, well... No worries, mate. It's perfectly normal."
Kid," Cheer up, eh? We'll find out what's goin' on soon enough."
Kid," No worries, mate."
Kid, You remember!? You do!? But you were just a li'l squirt 10 years ago. How can ya remember that far back?
Kid, What...? Ya had a strange dream? You say ya might end up hurtin' me!?
Kid," Git off it! Don't make me laugh! She'll be right, mate. I don't go down that easy, ya know?"
Leena, Rise and shine! A new day awaits!
Leena," Rise and shine, everyone! A new day awaits!"
Leena," I'm glad I found you here, though. Serge, right...? Kinda feels odd calling you that..."
Leena," You know... I've been thinking... Maybe you had some kind of accident and hit your head. That's why your memory's all messed up. You're really someone else, but you think you're the Serge who died 10 years ago."
Leena," I want to help you. I can't just leave you alone like this. And... You don't seem like such a bad person, either... You're planning to go to Termina, right? Then let me join you. I have some errands to run over there, anyway."
Leena," And to tell you the truth... It feels like I've always known you... Sounds strange, doesn't it?"
System, Leena joined your party!
Leena," Well, that's that! Shall we get going?"
Leena, OK! Let's head to Termina!
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU! Full thpeed ahead!
Kid, Oi! Let's get our arses down to Termina!
Kid," Oh yeah, mate... I nearly forgot... Let me give ya this. It's a Tele-Porter. You'll be able to switch yer party members from afar. A real handy gadget. All you have to do is... Ahh, it's a pain in the arse to explain... Look it up in the Menu."
System, Serge received Tele-Porter!
System, Mojo jooined-om yoour party!
Leena," No, grandma! It's not like that at all!"
Peppor, Shake it! W-We can't just shake it on back to the manor like this... We failed in our mission!
Solt," That was awfully awful, back there, Peppor. I want a rematch!"
Peppor, B-By the way... Do you remember what kinda outfit he was shakin'?
Solt, Hmmm...
Solt," Just something justly like that, Peppor!"
Peppor," O-Oh, you remember. So he looked like that, huh?"
Solt," Actually, it is him, Peppor!"
Peppor, S-So you're sure about that?
Solt," Wonderfully wonderful timing, Peppor!"
Peppor, L-Let's shake it! W-We're really gonna shake it to you this time!!!
Solt, Come at us with all your mightily might!
Peppor, W-We're really gonna shake it to you this time!!!
Solt, Are they seriously serious about escaping?
Peppor," W-We win! Solt, how about a handshake?"
Solt," But they're still there, Peppor!"
Peppor," Then, let's shake a leg!"
Solt," This time I made sure to bring a BLACK Element with me, Peppor!"
Peppor," Good work... Well, shake it on up and attack him with it!"
Solt," Affirmatively affirmative, Peppor..."
Solt, Oh deary dear! ......?
Peppor," That was no BLACK ATTACK Element you used just now, was it!? It was a Black Element that makes your foe MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO attacks of the opposite color attribute, WHITE, wasn't it!?"
Solt, I'm afraid you're right... How terribly terrible!
Peppor," You DID bring a WHITE ATTACK Element with you, didn't you!? If you didn't bring one with you, you're more stupid than I thought!"
Solt," Errh...... How awfully awful! I'm afraid I didn't, Peppor...!"
Solt, Retreat!!!
Peppor, L-Let's shake it on outta here!
Woman," Sorry, I'm totally out of bellflowers. There's a big ruckus down in Fossil Valley. Men from the dragoons were setting road blocks in the valley. I'll get some in a few days, so come back again then."
Woman," Oh, that's alright. I can get my flowers from other places, too. Never mind that, I haven't seen Karsh around here lately. How is he doing?"
Woman," A ghost!? Now that is something... I just hope it's not a sign of a coming disaster. If you ever see him, give him my regards."
Kid," Oi, did ya hear that? Karsh is that bastard we saw at the cape!? And that ghost he's huntin'... Ain't that you, mate? So, that Acacia Dragoon mob is behind this after all... Let's check this place out a bit more!"
Kid," Gawd, you're slow!? Ya made me wait forever. Makin' a lovely lady like......!?"
Kid, Ahaa...... So that's it.
Kid, You're walkin' a dog when ya don't even know who the hell you are?
Kid," I get it! This sheila over here is yer sweetie, eh? I'm right, ain't I? No need to be shy! I'm not so bold as to break up lovers' tender moments. I'm understandin'... I'll wait until yer little date's over."
Kid," Boy, you amaze me. Oh well, I guess it ain't such a bad idea to walk around and clear up ya mind a bit."
Kid," But geez, to go straight to the inn with a young girl... You're pretty slick for such an innocent lookin' boy! Well then, have a bloody good time...!!! Alright, all squeaky clean. It's got to be extra clean for the coming festivities."
Old Man," Master Viper... I'm here to polish your statue again!!! Have you folks come to see the Viper Festival? Termina is peaceful thanks to the watchful eye of our Master Viper. At times warm, at times strict, Master Viper watches over us always. With that said, of course the real Master Viper resides in his manor, along with his Acacia Dragoons. If you'll allow me to brag a little bit, I was invited to the manor a while back. It is a magnificent place... If there is a heaven on earth that would be it... The manor is beautiful and its design incorporates the surrounding terrain to its advantage, making it an impenetrable fortress. On top of that, there are powerful soldiers standing guard in front of the main gates that can destroy any monster with just one blow! Well, an upright citizen like myself might be invited to the manor's garden party, but not so for you folks. The most you will get is a cold reception from the gate guards. Ho ho ho!"
Kid," Alright, that's settled! We've gotta sneak into Viper Manor. You gotta find out what those Acacia Dragoons are up to, right? Why was Karsh tryin' to capture ya? I've got some business there as well, so I'll go with ya. How 'bout it, Serge? ~~~OK, let's go! ~~~No, I won't go"
Kid," It's the obvious choice, right? According to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a bloody large place, which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives."
Kid," What're ya afraid of? Don't give me that rubbish. You're a man, aren't ya? Don't ya wanna know what happened ten years ago, and what the hell's goin' on right now? Your only clues are that Acacia Dragoon mob and their leader, that Viper bloke. Any investigation into the Dragoons has gotta start with checkin' out Viper's manor. Accordin' to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a bloody large place. Which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives."
Kid," Alright, that's settled! We've gotta sneak into Viper Manor. You gotta find out what the Acacia Dragoons are up to, right? And why that Karsh bloke was tryin' to capture ya? I've got some business there as well, so I'll go along with ya. How 'bout it, Serge? ~~~OK, let's go! ~~~No, I won't go"
Kid," It's the obvious choice, right? According to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a bloody big place, which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives."
Kid," What're ya afraid of? Don't give me that rubbish. You're a man, aren't ya? Don't ya wanna know what happened ten years ago, and what the hell's goin' on right now? Yer only clues are that Acacia Dragoon mob and their leader, that Viper bloke. Any investigation into the Dragoons has gotta start with checkin' out Viper's manor. Accordin' to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a mighty large place. Which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives."
Kid," Alright, that's settled! We've gotta sneak into Viper Manor. You gotta find out what the Acacia Dragoons are up to, right? And why that Karsh bloke was tryin' to capture ya?

Kid," What're you afraid of? Don't give me that rubbish. You're a man, aren't ya? Don't ya wanna know what happened ten years ago, and what the hell's goin' on right now? Yer only clues are that Acacia Dragoon mob and their leader, that Viper bloke. Any investigation into the Dragoons has gotta start with checkin' out Viper's manor. Come on Serge, let's go. ~~~OK, let's do it ~~~No, I refuse"
Kid," Gawd, don't trouble me too much, Serge. According to grandpa here, this Viper Manor's a bloody big place, which also means it'll be easy to break into! There's gotta be more than one way in. If we don't plan this right, it'll cost us our lives. ......"
Kid," Ha, so that's how you're gonna be, eh? You're gonna live the rest of yer life in the shadows as a dead man's ghost. Is that right?"
Kid," You'll regret it!!! I'm partin' ways with ya here. But, 'cause I pity ya, I'll give ya this just in case. It's a Tele-Porter. This is a really handy gadget that allows ya to exchange party members from afar. The way ya use it is... Ah, forget it. Check it out for yerself. I hate explainin' the details."
System, Serge received Tele-Porter!
Kid," Don't ya ever show that face of yers again, ya mug! See ya!!!"
Kid," Oh yeah, Serge. I'll leave this in yer hands, just in case. It's a Tele-Porter. This is a really handy gadget that allows ya to exchange party members from afar. The way ya use it is... Ah, forget it. Check it out for yerself. I hate explainin' the details. Serge received Tele-Porter!"
System, Kid joined yer party!
Kid," Alright then, call me anytime! Bob's yer uncle, eh!"
Girl," Oh, how beautiful she is..."
Korcha," Hey, you! You think this is really fun? How wouldCHA feel if you were trapped in a tank like that, being stared at everyday, huh?"
Korcha, CHA! Shut up! What customers!? You're sellin' a bunch of bull! Why didn'tCHA keep the tank uncovered when I showed up?
Korcha, Heeey everybody!!! This shop is a bunch of boloney!!!
Korcha," Heh, I won't take that from a sleaze-bag like you!"
Korcha," Hey, you guys. You're not from around here, eh? Don'tCHA wander around too much, or you're gonna get burned. Just watch your back."
Poshul, PO-SHU!
Leena," Hey, Poshul!!! Stop that!"
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU...! You've rucked out for today!!!
System, Guile enigmatically joined your party!
Kid," Hey, Serge, that's nothin' but rubbish. Let's hurry up and get movin'."
Kid," Sorry, mum. I don't believe in fortune-tellin' at all. I make way for me own future by meself."
Kid," Ha, I don't give a damn. Let's go Serge."
System, ~~~Give it for free ~~~Ask for money ~~~Sorry
Glenn," Yes... I have engraved in my memory the lives of my father and brother, who had wielded the sacred sword Einlanzer."
Glenn," What do you mean by that? Miss Riddel, I cannot allow even you to..."
Riddel," Do you not think there is something odd about the dragoons of late...? Daddy's face shows such anguish, and even Karsh was saying he was sent on a 'ghost-hunt'..."
Glenn, Miss Riddel...
Riddel," Everyone has been acting oddly, ever since that beastly guest arrived at the manor."
Glenn, ......
Riddel," Glenn, promise me to always keep the unclouded truth in sight. Do not be swayed by the masses. The splendor of the Einlanzer must not be tarnished..."
Glenn, ...As you wish.
Riddel, Chuckle...
Glenn, ...?
Riddel," Oh, forgive me. I just found it a little awkward to hear you say such words... Chuckle..."
Glenn," ...... Miss Riddel, a chill wind has risen. Shall we return to the manor?"
Riddel, Yes... Of course.
Korcha, ...and that guy rushed and hid it as soon as I got there. It was a hilarious sight!
Korcha," Oops, I've got customers. Sorry, I'll getCHA some BIG fish next time you come by."
Korcha," Aw, shawdup!"
Korcha," Oh it's you guys. You're tourists, right? The festival's a waste of time. My name's Korcha. I'm here from Guldove, workin' as a ferryman. I can take you anywhere you like with this boat. I take money, but don't worry, it's not that much. My boatin' skills are quite famous around here, I guarantee a comfortable ride."
Kid," We've got business to take care of, so there's no time for a pleasure cruise. See ya!"
Member," We're a little busy, so maybe next time."
Korcha," Alright. If you ever want to get somewhere by boat, swing by."
Kid," Hey, you. We want to get to Viper Manor. Can ya take us there?"
Korcha, Viper Manor? WhatCHA gonna do up in that place? Ya gonna go steal treasure from the vaults or somethin'?
Kid, Don't go snooping into yer customers' privacy. Are ya gonna take us there or what?
Member, Then how about Viper Manor?
Korcha," As long as you can pay me, I'll take you anywhere you want. It's just that I don't know how to get to the manor. If you want to get there, bring someone who does."
Korcha," Back again, eh? I'll take you wherever you want."
Korcha," WhatCHA gonna do? ~~~To Viper Manor ~~~No, wait a minute"
Korcha, Are ya sure you can get into a place like that?
Korcha," You got it. But, it'll cost ya! It's gonna be 100G. ~~~Pay it ~~~Don't pay"
System,
Korcha," Hey, you ain't goin' nowhere without enough money!"
Korcha," !? What, don'tCHA wanna go?"
Korcha," Come on, get on board. It's a little tight with four of us, but it'll be a short trip. Don'tCHA worry about a thing."
Korcha, Don'tCHA think it's pretty dangerous!?
Kid, You sound confident...
Kid," Alright, let's get our arses in gear."
Member, ......
Member," Serge, let's go."
Korcha, What? You wanna head back?
Korcha," Well, hop on then."
Korcha, Headin' back already!? You just got here.
System, Get on the boat? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Acacia Dragoon, HUH!? INTRUDERS!!! Begin stone toss!!! Rrrarghhh!!! Arghhhhhh!!!
System, -10
Acacia Dragoon," AHHH! They made it up!? HA-HA-HAHA-HA... Let this be the end of you! Hiiiiya! Hah! Persistent, aren't ya! HA-HA-HAHA-HA... It's no use! Hiiiiya! Say good-bye! Darn... Have some of this! Ooops! Darn it! Huh? AHHHHHH...!"
Kid," Oi, Serge. We're inside the premises."
Kid, Let's wait here 'til nightfall.
Member," Serge, we made it inside the premises. Let's wait here until nightfall."
Zappa, ......
Zappa," Arrch! How many times do ah have to say it, dinnae let the customers back in here! How many years have ye been me wife!?"
Zappa," Arrch, ye'll never ken the delicate heart of a craftsman like yours truly."
Zappa," There not be just one or two, but three! Arrch, ye'll never ken the delicate heart of a craftsman like yours truly."
Zappa," Ah dinnae expect a layman like ye to ken what ah'm sayin', but... The art of smithin' may seem only like physical labor, but it requires far more mental prowess. Everytime the hammer strikes, a wee bit o' mah soul goes with it. Ah guess what ah'm sayin' is, thy soul is what makes the sword. So, that means yir yappin' is distractin' me, I cannae focus mah soul into the steel. D'ye ken? If so, then get going."
Zappa," Ah, why can ye no leave me be? This sword, it's no good now. Time to start over..."
Zappa," Take yir business up to the counter, ken?"
Zappa, Huh?
Zappa," That nail of yirs, it be a fine piece of work... Likesay it's the work of a skilled craftsman... Ay, there's no mistakin' it."
Pierre," I am on my way to see this General Viper soon. From what I hear, there is a vacancy among the 4 Devas of the Acacia Dragoons. Such a position is perfect for such a splendid swordsman as moi... One graceful flash of mon sword will surely have them saluting moi as the guest of honor..."
Pierre," But I have lost mon precious medal, symbol of heroism... Without it, I will certainly be turned away at the gate. Sacré bleu! What am I to do?"
Pierre," I have lost mon precious medal of heroism... I am on my way to see this General Viper, but... Without it, I will certainly be turned away at the gate. Sacré bleu! What is a hero like moi to do?"
Member, I know someone who's looking for that...
Member, I know someone who's looking for that...
System,
Pierre, ...... Why must you show that to moi? I am trés busy. Leave me be. Merci!
Pierre," Oui, monsieur! That is my medal! Merci, merci, thank you!!! Ahh la lah, what a darling you are!"
System,
Pierre, Now I can finally head to Viper Manor!
Pierre," I insist you take moi when you call at the gates of Viper Manor. Alone, of course, moi would have no problems, but you could also be useful... After all, thorns like you are necessary to add charm to a rose..."
Pierre," Now, come with moi! ~~~OK, let's go ~~~No, wait a minute"
Pierre," Without mon charm and complexion, les guards will turn you away!"
System, ~Pierre gracefully joined your partie!
Pierre," Now, follow my lead to Viper Manor, mon faithful followers!"
Zappa, Pierre... Ye still owe me last month's rent...
Pierre," Non non, monsieur! You shouldn't be so hasty! I shall pay you double... once I make it to stardom!"
Pierre," Non non, madame! You shouldn't be so hasty! I shall pay you double... once I make it to stardom!"
Pierre," That a boy! But, the most important trait of a hero is beauty. Perfect your appearance in the mirror everyday!"
Van," Bother! That is not it. Something is missing... I believe I am on the right track, however..."
Van, ...What is your opinion? ~~~I think it's good ~~~...But is it art?
Van," You really think so? Why thank you, but I still need to hone my skills a little more."
Van, ...... What would you know...
Van, Father... When did you come home?
Van," Oh, father... Off on another business trip, again...?"
Van, ......
Van," Father had promised to go see the festival with me... But then, he does not really care about the promises he makes with me!!!"
Van, I do not believe father even notices the view here. The colors of the sea and sky far surpass the beauty of those gems he collects. I do wonder if he really was a painter in his youth... It is rather hard to believe.
Nikki, ......
Leena," It's...it's nothing like that. He's...he's my cousin!!! Isn't that right, Serge? ~~~Yes ~~~No"
Leena," Oh Lisa, stop that nonsense! Oops, before I forget, this is for you. Mom told me to say hi."
Leena," Oh, you're so silly!"
Nikki, ...I thought I wasn't your type?
Man, Listen to my song!
Man, 'Ohhh oooh oooh...Ì Sweet sister of mine...Ì'
Man, Dammit! It's hopeless...
Kid, What's with him...?
Member, Who's that...?
Man, ......
Man, Dammit! You demons!
Man, ...... I can't fend them off alone!
Kid, What the hell's this thing...?
Member, What's this...?
Kid, The thing's fast asleep. What do we do now...?
Member, Is it asleep? we. can't get through.
Man, ......!
Man, It's you...
Man, What's this...?
Kid," Nice attitude, FREAK! We saved yer life! You could at least thank us!?"
Member, The least you could do is thank us!
Man," You're off to Viper Manor, right?"
Man, Take me with you.
Kid, Who the bloody hell are you?
Kid, Hmm? I think I recognize you from a poster in Termina...
Member, Who are you?
Member, Actually... there was a poster of you in Terimina...
Kid, And what business do you have in Viper Manor?
Member, What business do you have in Viper Manor?
Nikki, I believe... my sister is in there...
Kid, Your sister...?
Member, sister...?
Nikki, Anyway... I'll let you in on a secret if you let me join your party. How about it? ~~~Sure ~~~Nah
Nikki, Rockin'!
System, Nikki joined your band.
Nikki, Noooooo...!
Nikki, I'm tagging along whether you like it or not!
System, Nikki forced his way into your band.
Nikki," I'm the rockin' bard, Nikki! How about a song? ~~~No, thanks ~~~Nah... ~~~Maybe later"
Nikki, Oh... Fine...
Kid," Alright, so what's this secret you wanna tell us?"
Member," So, what's the secret?"
Nikki," In order to get inside Viper Manor, you have to go through the water vein further up..."
Member, But there's a monster blocking the way...
Nikki," In order to move it, you have to feed it one of the monsters in the forest. I wasn't quite sure how to lure one to it, but then I found this notebook. It says to lure the monsters with their favorite food."
Member, Favorite food?
Nikki," It's probably talking about the plant life growing in this forest. The plants are attracted to a certain aroma and then emit their pollen. There are a total of three monsters in all, each of which has its preference in food."
Nikki, I'll be staying by the port in Termina. Call on me anytime.
Nikki," Well, that's that. And now, for a song..."
Kid," Alright, let's get goin'."
Member, Let's go.
Nikki, H-Hey! Wait for me!
Nikki, I see...
Nikki," Well, you did help me out back there. Here's the secret."
Nikki," You saw that monster blocking the path, right?"
Nikki," In order to move it, you have to feed it these smaller monsters, but... I'll let you figure out the rest."
Nikki, Rock on.
System, Mixed among the pile of bones is one bone different from the rest. ~~~Pick it up ~~~Forget it
System, Member found Angry Scapula!
Member, So we have to wake this thing up.
Member, We have to defeat this thing. to get through.
Member, We have to defeat this thing to get through.
Member, What...?
System,
Zoah, SO... YOU ARE Serge. THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. I SHALL LET YOU PASS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DEFEAT ME.
Zoah, COME!
Zoah, YOU AGAIN. I SHALL LET YOU PASS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DEFEAT ME.
Zoah, COME!
Zoah, HAH! YOU COWARD! I WILL BE WAITING.
Zoah, DO NOT RUN ON ME THIS TIME.
Zoah, COME!
Peppor," It's them again... those tough guys! You said you brought a shakingly awesome Element with you, didn't you?"
Solt," I have a brilliantly brilliant Element this time, Peppor... It's a new... \'\Summoning Element!\'\"
Peppor," Shaking!!! It sure sounds good. Well then, shake a leg! Hurry up and use it on these smart alecks!"
Solt," Affirmatively affirmative! Here I go, Peppor..."
Peppor, Huh? Nothing happened! I wonder what went wrong...?
Solt, Ah......!? I forgetfully forgot! You can't use a Summoning Element until all the Field Effect attributes are the same color!
Peppor, ...... You muddle-head! Well then...hurry up and turn all the Field Effect attributes the same color and try again!
Solt," But, Peppor... You can't use the same Element twice in the same battle. Any foolish fool knows that!"
Peppor," Oh my god, Solt! Can't you ever do anything right?"
Zoah, UGH...
Zoah, VERY WELL... I SHALL LET YOU PASS...
Zoah, HAH... WE SHALL MEET AGAIN...
Kid, We're at the bottom of a well...
Kid, That means Viper Manor's right above us!
Kid," Hey, mate, I say we wait here 'til nightfall."
Member, We're at the bottom of a well...
Member," Serge, Viper Manor's right above us. Let's wait here until nightfall."
Nikki," ...Sorry, man. There was nothing I could do about it."
Nikki, ......
Girl, Are u Nikki? I am your wife and u are my sweet luvy-duvy! Nice to meetchu!
Woman, Yeeeeeahhhhh!!! Nikki's soooo cool!!!
Pierre," Yoo-hoo, there! Monsieur soldier-man! Moi have come here to to do you a favor and join the Dragoons. Open the gates, mon frère. Ta-ta-tah! We don't need any street performers. Now go on home. Get!"
Pierre," Non, non, non... Moi am a hero..."
Pierre," Ahh la lah... They said, non. Even mon hero's medal didn't work."
Pierre, Ahh la lah...? What should we do? We can't just barge in... ~~~Charge! ~~~Think up a plan ~~~Leave ~~~~
Kid, Hell yeah! C'mon!
Kid, Oi! Open up and let us through!
Member," Let's go, Serge.."
Member, We're here to see General Viper. Let us through.
Acacia Dragoon, You asked for it!
Acacia Dragoon, Don't mess with the Acacia Dragoons!
Acacia Dragoon, C'mon!
Acacia Dragoon, What happened? Chickening out?
Pierre," Oui, oui, oui! Leave it to moi!"
Member, What's he going to do?
Pierre," You are ready, non? Moi will act like I am malade. You two just follow moi inside."
Pierre, Ahhhhhh! Laaah...laaah!
Acacia Dragoon, What? What the...?
Pierre," Oh, the pain... the pain! H-H-Help moi...!"
Acacia Dragoon, Hey! Somebody come out here!
Acacia Dragoon, Yeah? What's wrong?
Acacia Dragoon, This joker fell sick. What should I do?
Acacia Dragoon," Ahhh, whatever. Just get rid of him."
Pierre, Huh?
Member, And...? What do we do next?
Pierre, CHARGE!!!
Acacia Dragoon, You asked for it!
Acacia Dragoon, What happened? Chickening out?
Pierre," Ooooooh... I see... Moi did not want to resort to this, but moi have no choice."
Member, What are you going to do?
Pierre, Just regardez moi in action.
Pierre, Go! Allez!
Acacia Dragoon, Huh? It's only a cat.
Acacia Dragoon, AHHH!
Acacia Dragoon, H-HEY!!! A-After them!!!
Pierre, Ha-haha... It worked out fine.
Pierre, Ooh...!
Acacia Dragoon, Stop! HEY! What are you guys doing!?
Acacia Dragoon, You're not gettin' away!
Acacia Dragoon, Give it up!
Acacia Dragoon, I'll get you!
Acacia Dragoon, You won't get past us! COME ON! Is that all you got? This is it! Give it up. You won't get through here! Halt! I'll get you!
Pierre, A-Are you serious...?
Member, Are we leaving? But now's our chance.
Member, Ar1e we leaving? But... now's our chance!
Pierre, I guess you are right.
Pierre, Excusez-moi... Are we leaving? But now's our chance.
Solt," What is it? Is there something wrongly wrong, Peppor?"
Peppor, S-Someone shook the gate open.
Solt, You are...!?
Peppor, Serge!
Solt, You cannot seriously be serious about coming through the front gate!?
Peppor, W-We're gonna shake it to you good and get our revenge!
Peppor, Shake it and show a little more guts.
Solt, Whenever you're readily ready!
Solt," This time, no running away."
Peppor, Y-Yeah! W-We're gonna shake it and get our revenge!
Peppor, Shake it and show a little more guts.
Peppor," C'mon, shake it!"
Peppor, The nerve of these guys! Thinking they can storm our front gate! This time we ought to give them the shaking they deserve!
Solt, I agreeingly agree!
Peppor," Today we brought along a helping hand! He's tough! He's mean! And he's really, really big, too! Show them what you can do!!! ...... I said show them what you can do! ...... Yoo~hoo! Oh, Ketcho~p! Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Peppor," Ooooohhh! You see...!? My, my! Aren't we strong now!? This time we're going to beat you for sure!!!"
Solt, What a manly man!
Peppor," Yes, that's the spirit! Show us what you can do!"
Solt, Go! Go! Ketchop!!! Try out your special Karate-Ket-Chop on them!
Peppor, Hey! What the hell are you doing? What did you heal them for?
Solt, Well... I thought that we all wouldn't get to see how fiercely fierce Ketchop is if they were left exhausted like that!
Peppor," Have you got your priorities straight!? Doesn't that defeat our whole purpose!? Do it again, and you're shaken dead meat, Solt!"
Peppor, This doesn't look good! We could be shaken here...! Hey! Ketchop! Why don't you shaking- well do something?
Peppor, Huh??? Wwaaaaaaah!?! What are you doing?
Pierre," Excusez-moi, but shouldn't we wait until nightfall?"
Kid," Tch... Yeah, I guess..."
Member, I guess so..
Member," Serge, shouldn't we. wait until nightfall? It leads down."
Member, We don't have time to be exploring other areas. It's locked.
Member, We need a key to open it.
Member, Any servant in Viper Manor should have one.
Member, There should be a dragon stable out back.
Kid, Bloody hell! I knew it was locked!
Kid," Serge, let's check out back."
Member, It won't open.
Member," Serge, let's check out back."
System, Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Member," We're not going back, are we? Now's our chance."
System, It leads down.
Member, Do you have a key to the manor?
Member," Do it, Serge.."
Kid," I'm glad I followed 'em. Not bad, fellas... Not bad..."
Kid, I'll just wait and see how things go.
System, It won't open.
Member, Wishful thinking...
Member, This door doesn't have a keyhole.
Member, Is this a trick door of some type?
Member, There must be a way to open it.
Acacia Dragoon, Intruders!?
Acacia Dragoon, How'd you get past our security?
Acacia Dragoon, Heh heh... I can't believe you would fall for a trap like this...
Acacia Dragoon, What should we do with these fools?
Kid, Heheheh...
Acacia Dragoon, What's so funny!?
Kid, You dragoons are a bunch of dag-nuts!
Acacia Dragoon, You're askin' for it!
Acacia Dragoon, Take it easy.
Kid," So you're afraid of us, eh? CHICK---EN!"
Acacia Dragoon, This should be interesting. Let's teach 'em a lesson!
Acacia Dragoon, Open it up.
Acacia Dragoon," Man, don't be taken in by her fast talk."
Kid," Bring it on, chums!"
Acacia Dragoon, I'll go ask the commander. Watch 'em. Enough of your ruckus! Quiet up in there!
Kid, !!!
Acacia Dragoon," I said, enough... Ughhh!"
Kid, What are you guys doin'? You're pathetic.
Kid," There...it's open. Gotta learn to take care of yerselves, eh? See ya."
Kid," Oh, and don't go interferin' with me work. And, Serge, you can't do bugger all without me, so just take it easy, eh?"
Acacia Dragoon, HEY! How'd you get out!? Shut up and stay put! Bastards! Come on! Who's the dag-nut? Argh! You want some!? QUIET!!!
Member, Why don't we. disguise ourseves with these suits?
Poshul, Me couldn't fit into it...
Member, No kidding...
Acacia Dragoon, Time for the next shift already?
Acacia Dragoon, All is well.
Acacia Dragoon, AHHH! Don't scare me like that!
Acacia Dragoon, You know what they say about full moons... Hehehe...
Acacia Dragoon, Ugh... A red demon... got me...
Acacia Dragoon," It was horrible... It was a 9 ft tall monster, with huge protruding fangs... (It's too embarrassing to say it was a girl...)"
Kid, Heheh! This is great!
Kid, But it looks like the Frozen Flame ain't here...
Kid, Ah well. Let's just take what's here.
System, There's a shield. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone There's armor. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone There's a sword. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone Received Hero's Shield. Received Bronze Mail. Received Bronze Sword.
System, There's treasure on the wall. ~~~Grab it ~~~Take it cautiously ~~~Take it nervously ~~~Too scared to take it
Member, This must be some kind of trap. we should leave it alone.
Kid, Whatever! Just grab it.
Member, What are you saying? We should take it.
Member, I told you.
Kid," Just a minor slip-up! But look, we got the treasure."
Woman, Oh...
Woman, Quiet!
Woman," You, too, Pip!"
Woman, Hmmm...
Woman, I see dat you are not really dragoons.
Member," Actually, we're just... well..."
Woman, No matter. Kom out.
Member, Who are you? and why are you helping us?
Woman, Ooh-hoho-hoho...! Vho said anyth2ing about helping?
Woman," I am the scientific genius of Viper Manor. Please, call me Luccia."
Luccia, You vill all be my guinea pigs.
Luccia, Finish dem...
Luccia, No. I vill let you go if you can defeat my Neo-N-Bulb.
Luccia, Vonderful... You have exceeded my expectations by defeating my Bulbs.
Luccia," Now, please leave."
Luccia, I must input dis battle data for future study...
Luccia, I'm busy. I vill let you go. Now leave.
Luccia," Oh... Pip? It is an evolving monster. It vill change its form as it battles. It is too early to test it out, so I have it caged. Do not free it, please."
Luccia, Vait...!
Luccia," I am extremely interested in all of you. I cannot leave right now, but kom by vhen you need my help. I am villing to help you."
Luccia, Ooh-hoho-hoho... I'll be vaiting...
Luccia, Kom back later. I'll be vaiting...
Kid," So the Frozen Flame ain't here, either... Guess I betta have a personal talk with that Viper bloke."
Kid, Move it!
Glenn, What!? It fell down again? How many times do I have to tell you? It's......to the right and ......to the left. Got that?
Glenn, Better write this down before I forget.
Glenn, I'm busy now.
Glenn," Please, I am busy."
Glenn, I'd better write that down.
Glenn, There...
Glenn," Ever since that guest from Porre came, the general has been acting strange. If only I could consult my brother about this..."
Karsh, Yeah? Whaddaya want? ~~~Who...are you? ~~~Who is this Serge? ~~~Who's General Viper? ~~~Tell me about Viper Manor ~~~What's this Frozen Flame? ~~~Never mind...
Karsh," WHAT!? You dunno who I am!? What are you, rookies!?"
Karsh," Well, listen up and don't forget! I'm one of the 4 Devas of the Acacia Dragoons, headed by General Viper. The name's Karsh! Gah-haha-ha-ha!"
Karsh," I said I'm Karsh, didn't I!?"
Karsh," Oh, you mean, junior. I had orders to bring in the ghost of that boy who died 10 years ago. But we had unexpected company and he got away."
Karsh," He seemed way too human to be a ghost, though..."
Karsh," Aaah, I don't know what that guest from Porre wants with him."
Karsh, The general is the head of the Viper clan and has governed these islands for generations.
Karsh," But that's not all. When he was ordered to take up a new post on the main continent, he made quite an impact as the leader of the Acacia Dragoons and was promoted to general."
Karsh, He has retired from the army since then and currently serves as the lord of El Nido.
Karsh," This manor was built by the general's ancestors 100 years ago, when people first began colonizing the El Nido Archipelago."
Karsh, Treat the place with respect!
Karsh," Aaaah... That's a top-priority, classified secret. Its existence has been rumored in the northern countries for generations... Legend claims it contains mysterious powers which can guide anima and change history... But no details are known."
Karsh, YO! Don't open that!
Karsh, I said don't...
Karsh," You're a pesky one, aren't ya...?"
Karsh, CUT IT OUT!!!
Karsh, You're still at it!?
Karsh, You must be really bored...
Karsh,
Karsh," Fine, fine... If you want it that badly, take it."
Zoah, WHAT? WHAT IS IT? ~~~Who are you? ~~~Never mind... ~~~Who are you? ~~~Who are the 4 Devas? ~~~Never mind... ~~~Who are you? ~~~Who are the 4 Devas? ~~~Tell me about Dario ~~~Never mind...
Zoah, HUH!? ZZZ...! ZZZ...!
Zoah, ARGH... ZZZ...!
Zoah, HUH!? WHAT DO YOU WANT? LET ME SLEEP.
Zoah, ZZZ...! ZZZ...!
Zoah, ARGHHHHHH!!!
Zoah, HAH! I AM ZOAH. ONE OF THE 4 VALIANT DEVAS OF THE ACACIA DRAGOONS.
Zoah," I SAID, I AM ZOAH."
Zoah," I SAY 4, BUT ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ONLY 3 OF US. KARSH NEXT DOOR, MARCY IN THE LIBRARY, AND I."
Zoah," OUR LEADER, DARIO, DIED IN AN ACCIDENT 3 YEARS AGO..."
Zoah," HE WIELDED THE HOLY SWORD, EINLANZER, AND WAS A TRUSTED CONFIDANT OF GENERAL Viper. HE WAS ENGAGED TO THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, MISS Riddel, AND WAS NEXT IN LINE TO BECOME THE HEAD OF THE VIPER CLAN. HOWEVER, HE DIED AN HONORABLE DEATH DURING HIS MISSION TO THE ISLE OF THE DAMNED, 3 YEARS AGO."
Zoah," KARSH WAS ON THAT SAME MISSION, BUT REFUSES TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT. DARIO AND Karsh WERE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS, ALWAYS COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER. DARIO'S DEATH HAPPENED SOON AFTER HE WAS ENGAGED TO MISS Riddel. MANY RUMORS HAVE SURFACED REGARDING HIS DEATH."
Zoah, ONLY I CAN OPEN THAT.
Girl," So, like... What are you doin' here!?"
Girl," Dragoons aren't allowed up here, you know?"
Member, We're not really dragoons.
Girl, What are you talkin' about?
Girl," So, like... What's your point?"
Old Man," What is it, Marcy? Is someone there?"
Marcy, Some weirdos.
Old Man," Hmmm... Marcy, lower the ladder, please."
Marcy, Alright.
Old Man, If you did not know you were not allowed in here...
Old Man, Then you must not be one of our dragoons.
Old Man," Oh my... You must be... Yes, yes... You must be Serge. My, how you have grown."
Marcy," Like, can I kill 'em, yet?"
Old Man," Patience child, patience! I need to have a word with these people..."
Member," Who are you? And how do you know, Serge?"
Serge, Who are you?
Old Man, Hmmm... How do I explain...? I guess you could say I am the prophet of time.
Kid," If what you say is true, and this world is an alternate reality..."
Kid, Then why the bloody hell did Serge die...?
Kid, The reason has to be somethin' that happened 10 years ago!
Member," If what you say's true, and this world's an alternate reality..."
Member," Then, why did Serge die...?"
Member, The reason has to be something that happened 10 years ago!
Marcy, No way I'm gonna let you!
Kid," Shut up, you little brat!"
Nikki, ...... Is Marcy your real name?
Marcy, Like... Whatever...!
Nikki, You... You look just like...mother...
Nikki, There's no doubt about it. You're my little sister!
Marcy, W-What's with you...? What-EVER!!!
Marcy, Can I!? Can I!?
Kid, We ain't here to play jacks!
Nikki, You're going to fight us?
Member, We don't have time for your silly games.
Kid, WHAT!? This little brat?
Member, You must be kidding!?
Marcy, Hee-Hee...! Too late now.
Nikki," You must be kidding. Marcy, think it over."
Marcy," Shut up, shut UP, SHUT UP!!! I don't know you and I don't have a family!!!"
Marcy, Say bye-bye!
Marcy, You think you're so smart! Then how about this...? Why you...!?! That does it! Oooohhhwww! I can't take thiiis! Take this! And this! And take that! And that!
Marcy," Is that all you got!? I was just starting to have fun! NahÌ, nahÌ, na-na-nahÎ!!!"
Marcy, Where do you think you're goin'!?
Marcy, Hmph! It's not over yet! I'll get you next time!
Nikki," Wait! Marcy, come back!"
Kid, Huh!? Who the...?
Kid, And who the bloody hell are you!?
Kid," Whadja say!? If you're gonna insult someone, you should at least speak propa English!"
Harle," Serge, mon puce... If you lie down with2 a dog like zis femme, you will surely catch fleaz, non?"
Harle, I t'ink you can do much better if you gave her up!
Harle," Actually, I suggest you all turn back. You should not defy him."
Kid, Oi!!! What's yer problem...!?
Harle," Pleaze, mon Serge."
Harle, I would hate to see anyt'ing sad happen to you.
Kid, I've had it up ta here with you!!!
Harle, Taisez-vous! You shut up!
Harle, I am having a serious converzation wit' Serge! Why don't you mind your own buziness!
Kid, THAT'S IT! Put up yer dukes!
Kid," I'm gonna kick yer arse so hard, you'll kiss the moons!"
Harle, You are ze one who iz going to have her derrière kicked! Non?
Harle, But alas... I cannot be caught fighting you here...
Harle, Imagine ze trouble I would get into...!
Harle," Au revoir, mon Serge! See you again! And Serge, pleaze dream of moi! Oui?"
Kid, Sheeze! What's her problem?
Kid," Hey guys, you know how to get up there, don't ya? Well, get goin'!"
Kid, We can't go down lookin' like this!
Kid, We can't go down lookin' like this!
Kid, Oi! Guys!
Kid, You plannin' on goin' down lookin' like that?
Kid, It'll be a major pain in the arse if we cause trouble now.
Kid, What? Did ya find somethin'?
Kid, Oi! Could this be...!?
Kid, Naah... It ain't the Frozen Flame.
Kid," Don't see any other booty here, either. I guess I betta ask the general directly."
Kid, ......!!!
Kid, So you're General Viper? Don't feign ignorance on me now! Why did ya send yer dragoons to get me mate Serge here!?
Viper," Serge...? My dragoons...? I'm afraid, my dear, I haven't the foggiest idea what you are talking about."
Kid, LYNX!?
Lynx, Hmm...? Young girl... Are you...?
Kid," What's the matter!? Cat got yer tongue!? I've finally caught you by the tail now, Lynx! I've come for two things... The Frozen Flame and yer life, ya murderer!!!"
Lynx," Aha... So you must be Kid, then... A member of the fearsome band of thieves known as Radical Dreamers, correct?"
Viper, Radical Dreamers...? This young lady...?
Lynx," Precisely! Don't let her innocence fool you, General. She's quite ferocious..."
Kid, Hah! Ferocious!? My arse...! After what you've done!
Lynx," I hate to disappoint you, but the Frozen Flame is not here. That fire lies hidden in the Sea of Eden, the place where past and future collide..."
Kid," Alright then... It looks like I'll have to put that part off 'til later. In the meantime, I'll settle my score with you, Lynx! Prepare to meet yer maker!"
Lynx, Ha! I have no business with you.
Kid, Serge!!!
Kid, We've come this far! No stoppin' us now!
Viper, You cannot escape.
Lynx, There is no escape. Now come!
Lynx, There is no escape.
Kid, Bugger...! It was just a shadow!
Lynx," Did you think I would be stupid enough to pick a fight with a rabid dog? Why, just a shadow of mine is enough to deal with the likes of you!"
Lynx," Now, Serge... What do you desire from this world? Do you wish to live again? Do you want to erase your demise from the pages of history?"
Kid," What's wrong, Serge!?"
Lynx," Listen to me... The end of the human world is nigh! When this time comes, Serge, there shall be a deep enmity between you and the world! This is not speculation or prediction... This is history!"
Kid, Bugger...! This doesn't look good...
Lynx, You cannot escape. There is something I want to ask you...
Riddel, Daddy! About that voyage I have been planning...
Riddel, Ooh!?
Kid, Don't move a whisker if you want this girl to live!
Riddel, Goodness gracious! Who are you!?
Viper," My darling Riddel!!! Why, you dirty...!"
Kid," Shuddup, old-timer! Our lives are at stake here! There ain't nothin' dirty about savin' yer own life...!"
Kid," Just stay calm and quiet, and I won't hurt ya, OK...? I just need ya to come with us 'til we reach a safer place."
Kid," You alright, Serge!? C'mon, let's bust outta here!"
Viper, Don't be foolish! Do you really think you can escape!?
Member, We're blocked in!
Karsh, You fiend...! Take your dirty hands off Lady Riddel!
Kid, Oh...OK... Whaddaya take me for!? An idiot!?
Karsh, GRRRRRR...!!!
Kid," Serge, this way."
Lynx," We have you now, you vermin. There is no way out of here."
Kid, Bloody hell!
Viper, Let's work out a deal.
Viper," Release my daughter, and I shall let you walk away. How about it?"
Kid," Yeah, right! Can't trust ya!"
Lynx, Are you willing to jump to your death?
Kid, Look out!!!
Kid, Ugh!
Lynx, What do you live for...?
Lynx, What are you willing to die for...?
Lynx," I've been waiting for you, Serge..."
Lynx," Waiting a long, long time for you... Now come to me, Serge! The Assassin of Time... THE CHRONO TRIGGER!!!"
Lynx," Come to me, Serge."
Lynx, N-NO!
Kid," Oi, Serge! Ya finally woke up, eh?"
Kid, Give yer thanks to Korcha. He's the one that saved us after we fell off the cliff.
Korcha, No sweat. It's just part of my job as a ferryman.
Korcha," But I have to admit, you caught me by surprise when you came fallin' from the sky. You're lucky that it was the sea thatCHA fell into and not the rocks!"
Kid," But geez, you're such a wuss! How could you get knocked out from such a short fall!?"
Kid, As for me... A little graze like this... ain't gonna...knock...me...down...
Korcha," Ugh, oh man! She's burnin' up! There's a clinic in this village. We should take her there. C'mon, I need your help, too!"
Korcha," Doc, if we find this Hydra Humour, we can save this girl?"
Doc," Yes, but that's impossible now. Hydras are now extinct on El Nido..."
Korcha," What do you mean, 'extinct?' What's goin' on!?"
Doc, Hydras are very rare and valuable creatures.
Doc," The blood, bones, meat... Every part is valuable. It's considered to be a panacea for various illnesses. That is the reason Hydras were hunted to extinction in El Nido. As a result, a whole species has been made extinct. Just to make a quick fortune."
Member," Is there no way to find this humour? If we could cross the sea to the mainland, th1er1e might be a chance, right...?"
Doc," ...That is not possible. The currents of El Nido are extremely dangerous, this time of year. It is highly improbable to cross the sea unless you are on a large vessel..."
Doc," Even if you manage to get there, your chances of finding Hydra Humour are bleak... We do not have much time."
Korcha, ...Doctor?
Korcha," H-Hey, Doc! Where are you going!? Nothing's been resolved yet!"
Doc, ...Excuse me. I need to be alone for a while.
Member," Serge, what are we. going to do? Kid is going to die if we leave her like this."
Korcha, I-Is this some kinda joke? Wait right here. I'll go get the doctor back!
Korcha, Whoa!
Korcha, Who the hell are you!?
Harle," What'z th1is? Non apologies for bumping into moi? Ooh la lah, don't you know any manners?"
Harle," Ha haa, she is down for th1e count, just as I t'ought."
Harle," Serge, mon ami, why don't we just leave her be?"
Korcha," Who are you, and what's with that strange costume!?"
Harle," Se taire! I have no buziness with no chicken-hawk. I am having a conversation with Serge. You're bothering moi, so keep your mouth shut."
Korcha, Why you...
Korcha, I ain't gonna letCHA barge into this room and get away with all the stuff you've said! You've made me mad. I'll show ya some manners! I'm not gonna cutCHA any slack just because you're a girl!
Harle, Try if you dare. I am not so weak as2 to be caught by a chicken-hawk!
Korcha," Heh, you've got some nerve. You're gonna regret it! Charge!!! Oops"
Korcha," Dammit, where'd she go?"
Harle, Ahahaha! You're amuzing.
Harle," Ahaha, such a simpleton. It's so much fun playing jokes on you. I was only here to see how she was doing, but I had fun while I was at it."
Harle," So long, Serge, au revoir, mon ami! Please dream of moi every night! Oui!"
Korcha," ...Tsk, she's a loon. What's her deal? I just don't get it."
Korcha," Yo, Serge, are all of your friends like that?"
Kid, Oooo...... Serge......
Korcha," ...C'mon, go talk to her."
Member," Serge, aren't you going to see Kid?"
Korcha, ...WhatCHA doin'? Hurry up and go show her your face.
Korcha," Hey, wait a minute! Where do ya think you're goin', leavin' a poor girl behind!?"
Kid," Serge, I'll leave this...with you. It's my favorite amulet. Serge received Astral Amulet."
Kid, Remember what the... prophet said... Serge... Where did...it all start? Where...do angels...lose their way...? ...Try to...remember...Serge.
Kid, I'm feelin' a bit tired... I'm gonna rest up... for a while...
Korcha," You heard what the doc said. There are no more Hydras in this world. On top of that, there's no way to get to the mainland, and El Nido isn't that small a place. Are you gonna take a one-in- a-million chance to search for this thing, just to save a girl you barely even know?"
Korcha," Hey, whatCHA gonna do? ~~~...I don't know ~~~Find a way to save her"
Korcha, Alrighty then! I'll come along with ya.
Korcha," ...By the way, do you even have a clue where to start lookin'?"
Korcha," Hey, do ya?"
Korcha," Tsk, that's what I thought. Where in the world should we start..."
Korcha," All we have left is that girl's amulet... Damn, what are we gonna do!? If only we had some kinda clue!"
Korcha, ...... That's right. The shaman...
Member, ...A shaman? that's an unfamiliar word.
Korcha," The shaman inherits the power of the Dragon God and governs the village. They're like a mayor or chief. The shaman might know something, although I can't say for sure. It's worth a try."
Korcha, We'll continue this outside. Let's decide what to do at the boat.
Korcha, Huh?
Korcha," Oh, you're... Luna, from Mel's place. What... Oh, hey..."
Korcha, ...... That Mel... What is she up to?
Korcha," What's up? It's just a cat. Strange guy. Come on, let's get goin'."
Korcha," We need to get goin' as soon as possible, but you probably need to equip yourselves, right? I'll be waitin' here. Call me when you're ready to go. We haven't got much time, so hurry."
Korcha," If you need to see the shaman, go down this way. Take the ladder to the second floor of the merchant tower and go left. There's a tower called the Dragon Shrine. Compared to Termina, this is a small village, so you shouldn't have any problems of getting lost."
Korcha, The Dragon Shrine is to the left on the second floor of the merchant tower. Don't forget to ready your equipment when you have time.
Girl," Dear sirs, you're travelers, right? Although I hesitate to do so, I have a favor to ask of you. I received this bone from a trader, but I would like you to set it adrift in the seas... I'm sure its real owner would like to have it returned to nature... So, can you fulfill my request? ~~~OK, I'll do it ~~~Sorry, I can't help you Why thank you! Here it is. Please take good care of it."
Doc," ...Another life is about to slip through my hands... just like before. Nothing has changed at all by studying medicine... Man, I am so powerless...!"
Doc, But I...
Doc," I have done them a discourtesy... I am a failure as a doctor, but I must do what I can. Thanks, Orlha..."
Doc," This is the best I can do without the antidote. Now, it is a matter of how long the patient can hold on..."
Steena," If events in your world are different from events here... It may be possible to save the girl, stricken with the Hydra poison. That is if the extinct Hydra still exists in your world..."
Steena," El Nido has long been called 'The Land Where the Dragons Sleep.' There are islands named after Dragons...and numerous Dragonian ruins and artifacts. You may have encountered some of these already. The most famous are the islands of the Sky Dragon, the Earth Dragon, and the Water Dragon. And the ancient ruin, 'Fort Dragonia,' that lies to the east. Of the many Dragonian ruins, Fort Dragonia is one of the few that is still fully functional."
Steena," It was stolen and taken away from Guldove by an unknown assailant. Their intent is unknown, but if they plan to activate the ancient ruin, a great disaster shall come about."
Steena, I will answer your questions to the best of my knowledge.
Steena, What would you like to know? ~~~That's all I need for now ~~~The Land of Genesis ~~~The Dragon Tear ~~~The Dragonian Ruins ~~~The 6 Dragon Gods ~~~The Frozen Flame
Steena, What would you like to know? ~~~That's all I need for now ~~~The Land of Genesis ~~~The Dragon Tear ~~~The Dragonian Ruins ~~~The 6 Dragon Gods ~~~The Frozen Flame ~~~The Divine Dragon Falls
Steena, The Land of Genesis... I have no idea where it may lie...
Steena, But...all phenomena have their reasons... I feel that there is some other will acting behind this220 something other than the fact that you are dead in this world.
Steena," The dimensional distortion that Chief Direa mentioned earlier... Assuming that this exists in the Land of Genesis, why could you not return to your real world? I find that truly puzzling..."
Steena," I believe that there is a 'key item' that you need to make the jump between worlds. Something that matches the missing piece of the puzzle. Something powerful enough to send Serge. back, who is a missing piece of this world..."
Steena," It is a one-of-a-kind orb that our ancestors received from the now extinct Dragonians. Traditionally, it was passed down to each successive shaman, but someone has taken it away from Guldove."
Steena," According to legend, the Dragon Tear is required to activate the ruin of Fort Dragonia... It is a tough and steep trail to the top, not even the locals venture up there. But even so... If the assailant's goal is to activate the fort, it will certainly bring disaster to this world..."
Steena," But since the Dragon Tear was stolen, we cannot deny that this threat may become a reality."
Steena," The Dragonian artifacts are the many buildings and sculptures still found on El Nido today. But most of these have weathered away, and only a small portion of them remain intact. The only one that retains its complete form is Fort Dragonia, which we have discussed before. It stands at the peak of Mount Pyre."
Steena," Have you noticed that many of the islands were named after dragons? This is because those islands were where the Dragon Gods resided. But as human society grew less concerned for nature, the Dragon Gods chose to hide from the world's eyes..."
Steena," As you may well know, the natural world is composed of a balance of the 6 Elements. These Elements are... White, black, red, blue, green, and yellow. Each one pairs up with another to maintain the balance which the natural world relies upon."
Steena," If the sun is white, the shadow is black... The flame red and the water blue... Green are the leaves of the forest and the blowing winds. Yellow are the forces of mother earth."
Steena," Long before man inhabited El Nido, the Dragon Gods have protected the lands. The islands are named after the"
Steena, But several hundred years have passed since settlers from the mainland came to El Nido. The only Dragons that can be seen today are the White and Black Dragons. No one knows the location of the other Dragon Gods...
Steena," ...A Frozen Flame? That is something we have not heard of in these parts. But, there is something about flames in the oral lore of our tribe. I do not know if this is related to the flame you speak of, but allow me to share it with you."
Steena, Be very careful when you stare into the flame... ~ ~ ~ For the flame will also stare back at you... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ It will either transform you into a different being... ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Or burn you into ashes.
Steena, In an old poem of El Nido there is a phrase that refers to the evil sealed away by the 6 Dragons.
Steena, ...An evil flame. If this refers to the Frozen Flame... It should not be in the hands of humans... Yet the truth about this story is unknown.
Steena," This was about a hundred years ago, before immigrants from the mainland came to El Nido. The now extinct Dragonians, demi-humans, and our ancestors lived on the main island and not on the outlying islands."
Steena," It is a sacred land that is dedicated to the worship of the sleeping Dragon Gods... For you to have accidently found this holy ground, means the planet might have guided you there..."
Steena, May your journey be blessed with the guidance of the 6 great Dragon Gods...
Korcha, Are you ready to go? ~~~Not yet ~~~Ready any time
Korcha," Hey, someone's life depends on this. Hurry up will you!"
Korcha, Are you ready this time? ~~~Wait just a bit longer ~~~I'm positively ready!
Korcha, ...Do you really want to save that girl or what? Hurry up and get ready!
Korcha," Alright, let's go. Please don't make me do this again, OK?"
Korcha," Are you really sure? Don'tCHA dare tell me you want to come back later! Think about it really carefully. Are you positively sure? ~~~I'm ready ~~~Sorry, just a little longer"
Korcha," Then get yourself ready. Someone's life depends on you, so hurry up! Geez... You've got no sense of urgency."
Korcha," Alright, we're off. All of you get in the boat."
Korcha," Hey, don't be such a hardhead. It's not like we're robbin' from anyone. Besides, nobody else is dockin' here, right?"
Korcha," Here, keep it."
Korcha," (I thought this might happen, so I snagged some from my ma's kitchen.)"
Korcha, Don't worry. I'll get some more for you.
Korcha," If you don't hurry, that girl's gonna die. You two can't do this alone. Why don'tCHA let me come along?"
System, Korcha temporarily joinedCHA party!
Korcha," If you don't hurry, that girl's gonna be dead. What do you need? ~~~Return to Guldove ~~~Take Korcha with you ~~~It's nothing"
Korcha," Whoa, whoa! Aren't you in a hurry!? Are ya sure you want to return? ~~~Return ~~~No, hold on a minute"
Korcha, Are you serious?
Korcha, That girl's gonna be in serious condition if you don't hurry!
Korcha," Head back to Guldove? ~~~Return ~~~No, wait a minute"
Korcha," How, huh? There's not much to explain, since boats are more commonly used than shoes for movin' around in Guldove."
Korcha, That's not exactly why...
Woman, Sob...sob... Why... Why did such a sweet child have to...
Man, My only wish was to drink with you when you have grown up... Why? Why did you have to leave us so...?
System, Greco tags into your party!
Man, Y-Yipe! It's the possessed giant!!!
Man, Y-Yes!!!
Zappa," Weapons are made for hurtin' other people. That's why we can't be happy by sellin' those things. Rather, we should pray that they never be used."
Zappa," Ye remember that, laddie."
Van," Oh, bother. It appears that the festival may be canceled, too... I believe I may end up watching everything from this balcony like I did last year... Ho-hum..."
Girl, I thought Korcha was leaving it for me...
Korcha," No, it's not me."
Girl, Who could it be then?
Nikki," Thanks for your support, doll! I hope you have a blast at the Magical Dreamers performance."
Luccia," Dis Homosap flower is called 'NeoFio.' As it matures, it vill behave just like a human."
Luccia," However, dis NeoFio is like none ot'er. It is a poverful type, vith the ability to use Elements."
Luccia," Naturally, it vas I vho improved it. Ooh-hoho-hoho."
Luccia, One is able to train it if it blossoms. But a 'Life Sparkle' is neccessary for dat.
Luccia," I have pinpointed the vhereabouts of a Life Sparkle to a marsh east of Arni Village. So I sent some of our dragoons to retrieve it. However, none have returned..."
Luccia," It is a shame, but I cannot allow anymore loss of life..."
Luccia, I suggest you stay avay from dat marsh if you vish to live...
Riddel, Oh my goodness... That night... You are the ones who...
Riddel, Kid risked her life to shield me...
Riddel," My father and his men have left for Fort Dragonia. I do not know exactly where he is, though."
Riddel, There is not a single thing I can do... except pray for their safety.
Member, What is this? some kind of transport?
Luccia, Vot are you doing?
Luccia, Vot is it you vant?
Luccia, Dä?
Member, ~~~Would you like to join us? ~~~Oh it's nothing.
Luccia, Dä...
Luccia, Dä... I guess I should get out more often and gather research material.
Luccia," Sigh... Vithout Pip, I really do not have any research here. I guess the time is right."
Luccia, I am sure I can find some interesting research material if I tag along vith you.
Luccia, I vill join you. Ooh hoho hoho!
System, Luccia assimilated into your party.
Luccia, Please call me anytime. I vill be vaiting.
Member, (what are those two talking about...?)
System, ......!? There's something on the ground.
System,
Luccia, I suggest you stay avay from dat marsh if you vish to live... Vait a minute! You are holding a Life Sparkle!
Luccia," Vot kind of powers does dat boy have...? Anyvay, please go feed it to NeoFio."
System, NeoFio joined your party.
Luccia, You... Kom to my lab later.
Korcha, Is this the place? It's justCHA average beach.
Macha," Is this Opassa Beach? The place where the flow of time splits in two? It's justCHA normal beach, but I like it!"
Poshul," Me knew there wath thomething fishy about thith place. My animal inthtincts tell I tho, too. Thniff, thniff..."
Nikki, Rockin'... So this is Opassa Beach. Where angels lose their way... I wonder if it's true that the flow of time has split in two?
Pierre," This is Opassa Beach, oui? The place where the flow of time splits in two, non?"
Leena, Serge... Is this where you came from? Is this how you came into our world? I knew it... It was Opassa Beach.
Member, Where angels lose their way... the place where the flow of time s1plits in two...
Korcha," So, Serge. WhatCHA gonna do now?"
Macha," Come on, Serge.! WhatCHA gonna do? That child's life is at stake! Just remember that!"
Macha," Come on, Serge.! WhatCHA gonna do?"
Poshul," Hey, Serge., what do we do now?"
Nikki," Serge., let's just get on with it. I don't have time for a leisurely walk on the beach."
Pierre," Excusez-moi, but what do you want us to do here? It looks like an ordinary beach to me, Serge.... Oh, anyone have a parasol they can lend moi?"
Leena," So, what's the plan now, Serge?"
Member," What do we do now, Serge?"
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU! What ith thith? Will thith take uth to the other world? Very dangerouth!
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU! What ith thith? Ith thith how we made it to thith world?
Leena, Hey... What is this? It's kinda scary going in this thing...
Korcha, What the hell is this thing? I'm not really used to supernatural stuff.
Member, What is that...? Is it reacting to something?
Poshul, PO-SHU!? Ith thith what you call a wormhole? A hole that connects here and there?
Leena, So this is the wormhole? The dimensional wormhole that connects 2 worlds?
Korcha," So this is the hole that connects the 2 worlds... The whatCHAmacallit hole, right?"
Pierre," Aaaah, oui... This is the dimensional wormhole that connects the deux worlds, non? Ahh la lah..."
Member, So this is the dimensional wormhole that connects the two worlds...
Member, It felt like my body spit in two. a very strange feeling....
Leena," So we made it to the other world, right? Are you sure, Serge? I still find it hard to believe."
Member," So now we're in that other world... I still can't believe it, though."
Leena," ...... You really are Serge, aren't you...?"
Leena," You're alive in this world, living a normal life with me."
Leena," But in the other world, ...you're dead... And I'm living a different life without you..."
Leena," Sure is strange, though..."
Leena, You couldn't tell from the sea or the sky... They look the same...
Leena," So tell me, Serge. How's it going with the me in this world?"
Leena, Have we kissed yet?
Leena, Well? Well?
Leena, Come on! Tell me!
Leena, Heeey!? That girl looks like me...!?
Leena," Hah-hah... Surprised? Well, there's something real deep behind all this. You should have Serge explain it to you. When it's all over, of course."
Leena," Wow... It just seems so weird. I don't know what's going on, but good luck!"
Leena, You got it! Leave it to me!
Leena, Serge! Where have you been!? You had me worried sick! You just suddenly disappeared from the beach. That was some magic trick! Don't even think about pulling that one again. Once is enough for me.
Man," Oh, you're with Leena. Well, I'm sure you'll be OK if she comes along, hehheh..."
Leena, Hey! What do you mean by that!?
Man," Uhhh...well...ahh...nothing! You want to go further into the forest, right? Well, if it's the 3 of you, I'm sure you'll be OK. Do you have some kind of business here? ...Hmm, I won't ask you what it is. I can tell by the look on your face that it's something important. Here, go on through. I'm sure the 3 of you can handle yourselves. Before you enter here, I'll give you a word of advice... The marshes are like a maze full of poisonous monsters. Be prepared!"
Korcha," WhatCHA doin' standin' there in a daze!? I hate cold and clammy places! Besides, we ain't got time to sit and toast 'marshmallows,' man!"
Member, Serge! What are you doing just standing there in a daze like that? We haven't got time to spare! let's keep moving!
Member, Everybody down! something big's heading our way!
Member, what was that thing? I can't believe this place!
Member, Did you just see a strange looking creature up ahead?
Member," Why don't you try blowing the flute here, Serge?"
Member, ......
Member, A wide open space... Could this be it?
Member," Serge, why don't you try blowing that flute?"
Member," Looks like we fell for its trap. It's do or die, now!"
Member," Serge! Prepare for battle while we hold this thing off! There's nowhere to run as long as we're up this tree! Jump in the big hole? ~~~Go for it! ~~~Nah, too dangerous"
Member, So this is Wingapede. It's actually smaller than I thought.
Member," Serge, why don't you try feeding it something?"
Member," Hurry, Serge! we can't hold it off much longer! there's nowhere to run from up this tree! ~~~Just a bit longer ~~~OK, let's do it!"
Member," The foothold could give way at any minute. Serge, we should avoid passing through the middle."
Member," Who would have thought there would be a cavern inside of this tree? Let alone this big, old monster!"
Member, Well at least it served as a cushion to break our fall. Otherwise that would've hurt!
Member," If old five-legs here wakes up, we could be in a lot of trouble! We should try and get out of here while we still can!"
Member," Hey, Serge! Is that really a fairy? I've never seen one before!"
Member, We can't just leave her trapped like this! Let's help her out!
Member, I don't believe this! It's just one battle after another!
Member, But this time we're trapped in a hole! With no way out! We've got no choice but to fight!
Member," Hey, Serge! Aren't we going to help that fairy out? the poor thing could die if we leave it a prisoner in that cage like that!"
Leena, I've heard of that island. The old fisherman in my village sometimes spoke about it. But he says that because of the strange dry spell we've been having lately the island's water source has dried up! I wonder if it's the same thing in this world?
Member," I've heard rumors about that island they say that due to the abnormal weather they've been having, their water source has dried up. But that was in the other world we just came from. I wonder if it's the same thing in this world?"
Member, Serge... Perhaps we'd better explain! Razzly Gee... So there's another world...? And you've come to these marshes in this world to save your friend in that other world?
Member, Yes...you seem to have got it. But actually Serge is originally from this world! we don't expect you to believe us but it is true! we traveled through a wormhole to your world!
Member, We need the hydra humour to make the medicine that'll save our friend!
System, Razzly joined your partee-hee!
Member, Those who don't learn the first time are bound to repeat the same mistake!
Member, We should get going before this thing wakes up.
Poshul," The Hydra mutht be up ahead. Ret'th go, Serge.!"
Member," The Hydra must be up ahead. Let's go, Serge.!"
Member, We're surrounded! ~~~Prepare for battle ~~~Fight!
System, Can't escape!!! ~~~Prepare for battle ~~~Fight!
Member," Wait a minute. we're not going to leave empty-handed, are we? We came all the way out here to save Kid. Don't tell me you forgot, Serge.."
System,
Member, There's not a single dwarf roaming this forest anymore... Have they abandoned this place?
Member, ...Let's hurry.
Korcha," That's the stuff we needed to save that girl, huh!? Then there's no time to lose! Full speed ahead! ~~~Return to Guldove ~~~Wait just a minute"
Korcha, Let's rush that over to the doctor right away. C'mon! You guys hurry too!
Korcha," Gotta head back, full speed! ~~~Return to Guldove ~~~Wait a minute"
Korcha," Hey, Serge.. Let's hurry up and get that to the doctor right away!"
Doc," ...Oh, it's you dudes. The patient's strength is at its limit. Without the antidote..."
Doc," Can this be!? Hydra Humour...but how? We will discuss that later. As long as we have this, making an antidote will be easier than catching a wave! We can save the girl with this!!!"
Doc," We will prepare an antidote right away. Nurse, help me with the preparations! Stat!"
Doc," I have no idea where in the world you found this...nor do I know who you really are... But now is not the time to ask such questions. You have done your part, now you can leave the rest to me."
Korcha, You heard the doc; we've done all we can. Just trust him and wait.
Member, It's already close to nightfall.
Korcha," Doc, how is she? Will she be alright?"
Doc," Yes, she has passed the critical period. There are no signs of complications from the poison. The girl has held up well, but only thanks to you dudes. You have done the impossible by finding the antidote... I still cannot believe it..."
Doc," You, with the red bandana, you are Serge, correct? She would like to speak with you. It would be a little while longer before she falls asleep from the anesthetic. Will you speak with her, dude?"
Doc," I will be in the room next door, so call me when you need me. And do not forget that even though the poison is gone, she has not completely recovered. ...Well then, catch you later, dude. You haven't talked to Kid yet. There's no way you can leave the room!"
Kid," Hehe, you've become bloody handsome while I was out of it."
Kid," I don't know all the details, but I heard what happened from the doc. Looks like there's been a lot goin' on while I was asleep... I guess it proves that you can take care of yerself now, eh?"
Kid," ...Oi, Serge. Ya did good, mate. Why don't ya look cheerful for a change?"
Kid," Ha, I would've been alright without any antidote at all! Struth... Now I owe ya one..."
Kid, Serge... Thanks.
Korcha," ...is how it is, Doc."
Doc," ...A world different from our own? That is far out, man...! That there really is such a thing... And you dudes are from this other world, I presume?"
Korcha," Just to make it clear, Doc. The only one that's from the other world is Serge.. All the others, including myself, are from this world. We're all with him for different reasons, though."
Korcha," Whoops, my bad. I totally forgot. Come to think of it, the first time we met you was in the Hydra Marshes."
Poshul," Ahem! Me wath with Sergeipoo, too!"
Poshul," ...... PO-SHU, why am I treated tho lightry!?"
Korcha," U-Um, try not to worry about the details! It'll just make you tired, OK?"
Poshul,
Doc, Another world... So I suppose some things are slightly different. The Hydra Marshes are a good example of this. Otherwise we would have never found a Hydra in this world.
Doc," Parallel worlds, never to cross each other, yet existing alongside one another..."
Korcha," Hey, Doc, let's not think too deeply about this. There isn't any easy way to explain it. Even after going through it myself, I still doubt what I saw. Let's just drop the theories, Doc! The girl's been saved. That's all we need to know, right?"
Doc," Well, I guess you are right... I cannot find an answer to this by thinking about it on my own."
Doc, It is pretty late. We have been talking for quite some time... Let's call it a night. One good day's rest should be enough to let her get up and hang ten.
Kid," Whatcha gonna do, Serge? You've already found a way back to your own world, right? You could just go back home and live a peaceful life, pretending that nothin' ever happened. But can ya really forget everything you've seen here? And can ya live with yerself after ya turned yer back on us?"
Kid," What are ya gonna do, Serge? ~~~Go back home ~~~I won't go back yet"
Member," Serge, are you sure you're going to be satisfied with that?"
Member," Think about it, Serge! Why did you take the trouble to cross the worlds to help Kid? It wasn't just because you wanted to go back to your world, right? You had other reasons to come back to this world!"
Kid," I see... Then I'll stick around with ya a little longer. But just don't slow me down, ya hear?"
Kid, I don't know what happened 10 years ago... But it looks like Viper's mob has got something to do with it. Let's go after 'em. I need to go bash up that Lynx character and get me hands on the Frozen Flame!
Kid, Lynx... He stole something precious from me... He's taken away my future...! I'll find him! No matter what it takes!
Kid," Korcha, I heard that ya helped in the search, too."
Korcha, Hmph. It was nothing.
Kid," Yeah? Well, thanks for nothin' then..."
Korcha, ...Now then.
Korcha," At one point I thought we were doomed for sure, but it looks like it's all settled now."
Korcha," All that's left is to take you guys back to Termina, right? My job ends there. You get a special discount price of 300G for the round trip. Sorry, but I need to make a livin' too."
Kid," Haha, you're pretty damn shrewd, eh? I shouldn't have thanked ya earlier. Hmm?"
Korcha, What is it? Ya lookin' for something?
Kid," ...Hmm, yeah. Well, the Elements I had on me Grid are gone."
Kid," Oi, Serge. Didja remove the Elements from me Grid?"
Kid," Hmm, if it wasn't you... then who did?"
Korcha," The only ones looking over you while we were gone were the doc and the nurse. They should be in the room next door, so let's ask them when we head out. The doc should know something."
Kid, ...... I hope you're right.
Korcha," Huh? Mel, whatCHA doin'..."
Korcha," Mel, wai..."
Doc," What is it, dude? Is Mel up to something again?"
Korcha," Well, yeah. The same old mischief, but... This time, she's gone too far."
Korcha," Geez, that idiot... What is she thinkin'? I don't get it. I'm sorry about her, Kid. I'll get the stuff back from her later, so go easy on her, alright?"
Kid," Ahh, that's no problem. It ain't anythin' I'll suffer without anyway. Not to be rude, but I don't have time to play around with brats. I've gotta go chase after Lynx, now!"
Kid," Hmm, what is it, Serge? ~~~You need those Elements ~~~...It's nothing"
Kid," ...Well, you're not wrong! But Korcha said that he'd get them back later. We don't have time to waste. Ain't that right, Serge? C'mon, mate, let's go. ~~~...Alright, let's go ~~~No, let's go after Mel"
Kid, Why are you actin' so strange? Just when I thought you'd loosened up a little... Don't worry. Korcha said he'd get back me stolen stuff later. Let's just get a move on!
Kid," Ahh, alright. If ya insist. OK, then let's go find that brat right away. Time ain't gonna wait for us!"
Kid," That's the plan, Korcha. Why don't ya help us out a bit. It'll be over a lot quicker that way."
Korcha, GotCHA!
Doc," Hmm, I am beginning to wonder if curing you was the right course of action. Such a ruckus in the clinic interferes with my work... But I guess your antics are proof of your youth, dude!"
Korcha," Don'tCHA worry, Serge.. Leave the rest up to me. I'll go grab that kid after I take you guys back to Termina. I won't make you guys wait long."
Doc," I have caused much trouble for you dudes with this incident. It is embarassing, as a doctor. I assume you are going to continue your journey? Try not to take too many risks. One must live strongly because life is limited!"
Korcha," Well, it's nothing big; if she isn't here, that's OK."
Man," Chief Direa is in prayer. You may not enter the shrine now, come back a little later. It shouldn't be that long. ...Hmm, what brings you here, Korcha? It's rare to see you come out to this tower."
Korcha," Oh, never mind that. By the way, have you seen Mel around here? We're lookin' for her right now."
Man," ...Mel? No, I haven't seen her today. Have you tried the residential tower?"
Korcha," So, she hasn't come this way... Thanks for the info!"
Korcha," As you've just heard, she hasn't come this way. The only place left is the residential tower. The sea is the only other place to hide, but that's not likely. Once we corner her, it's all over. Let's go!"
Korcha, ...Huh?
Korcha," Mel's heading for the residential tower! We've got her cornered now. OK, let's go! We should find her in no time."
Korcha, This is the end. There's no place to run.
Kid," So, what're we gonna do? If all three of us barge in at once, she's gonna escape."
Korcha," There are three exits to this tower. If we each go in through a different exit, there's no escape."
Korcha, Listen up. Don'tCHA dare let Mel get outside!
Korcha," Yup, I'm countin' on ya!"
Korcha," Now, there are two more left. We'll even end up with some manpower to spare. It's game over, Mel."
Korcha, Let's do it!
Korcha, You idiot. That's whatCHA get for messin' with my customers! I'm not gonna forgive you just for cryin'!
Kid," That should be enough. We've got me stuff back, and there's been no harm done."
Korcha," ...Even so, we have to teach this kid some proper manners. You never know when she might do it again!"
Kid, Don't worry about such minor stuff. I say it's already forgiven... Let's just leave it at that.
Kid, Besides... The little 'un's got some guts to steal from a member of the Radical Dreamers! Hahaha!!!
Kid," Oooh, how feisty...!? So she's got real spirit, too! But weren't ya cryin' just now? Or were ya just fakin' it? I tell ya... She's gonna be a real mean one when she grows up! Hahaha!"
Kid," Whoops! I guess you're still just a little 'un. Don't worry, just forget it!"
Korcha," ...Hey, are you sure you want to leave it at that? I just don't getCHA. Oh well, no use botherin' with it now."
Korcha, Then I'll go ahead and wait for you at the docks. Come and find me when you're ready to go.
Kid," Alright, let's get movin' then..."
Korcha," You want to go back to Termina? ~~~Not yet ~~~Yep, back to Termina"
Korcha, Take your time there's no rush. You probably won't be coming back here anytime soon anyway. I'll wait here for you until you're satisfied. Gimme a holler when you think you're ready to go.
Korcha," OK, let's go. Heh, it was nice knowing ya, but this is good-bye."
System, Korcha leftCHA party.
Korcha," I'll take care of getting back the stolen Elements, so don'tCHA worry. It was just a kid's prank, so go easy on her, alright? OK, then, come and find me when you're ready to go."
Korcha, Here we are in Termina. You're on your own from here.
Kid," Oi, Serge, didja hear that? When I was snoozin' away in Guldove, Lynx and his mob hightailed it out of the manor. That fort's supposedly a ruin built by the extinct Dragonians... I heard there've been all kinds of mystic rituals there. It's said that the Dragon Tear was needed for the rituals... Bloody bastards, what are they up to now? Serge., this is no longer just our problem. If we don't stop these buggers now, they're gonna cause some major hell around here!"
Member," Fort Dragonia is on top of Mount Pyre, southeast of hear. It'll be hard to get there by land, so... the question now is how are we going to get a boat?"
Glenn, ~!?~
Glenn, Blonde braids... A blood red blouse... That sounds like the description of that thief from the Radical Dreamers...
Glenn, And that red bandana... He is just like the ghost Karsh was describing.
Kid," So what? Ya wanna take us on or somethin'? Sorry dorry, but we're in a bit of a rush.... to that Fort Dragonia of yers..."
Glenn, What business do you have at the fort...? That makes me even more suspicious... I will draw my sword if needs be...
Woman," Oh, Glenn, stop that! Your brother would never have drawn a sword in such circumstances!"
Glenn, Leave my brother out of this!
Kid," Oi, don't get yer knickers in a knot... I don't care if ya draw yer sword or what, but I ain't stoppin' for ya. See ya!"
Glenn," All right. Forgive me for my rash behavior... Come to think of it, I really have no interest in who you are. Really, I only want to know the truth of what is happening here. I shall follow my own way to find the truth."
Glenn," If you intend to go to the fort, I would offer you a word of advice. When you get on your boat, first head north, and then east. You should find a small island there. A retired dragoon now lives there. Find him and ask for his advice. There are many frightful rumors about that fort, you know. You never know what to expect there."
Kid, All we need to do now is to find a boat! Let's git a move on it!
Korcha," You guys need to cross the sea? Then I might, just might, think about lending you my boat. With two conditions..."
Kid," Ha, with that clunky boat of yers, I don't think we're gonna survive a round trip. But I guess this ain't the time to be picky. So, Korcha, what are yer conditions?"
Korcha," First, if you ever find the Dragon Tear, give it to me."
Korcha," The other condition is... O-Once all this ruckus is over... Um... I wantCHA to... Mumble, mumble..."
Kid, What was that? Stop mumblin' and speak up. I can't hear ya.
Korcha, I a... Arrgh... I wantCHA to be my wife!
Kid, Huh...? What...did you just say?
Korcha," I said, 'I WANTCHA TO BE MY WIFE!'"
Kid," ...!!! Oi, Korcha!!! Don't mess with me! I'm gonna kick yer arse so hard you'll kiss the moons!"
Korcha," I'm not joking! To tell you the truth, I, um... That it... It was... love at first sight..."
Kid," Mmmnn...! Oi, ya know who I am, don't ya!?"
Korcha," Yeah, you're some kind of thief, ain'tCHA? Don'tCHA worry. I don't care about your past, and I don't wantCHA to feel forced. We can wait until all this fuss is over. So, please..."
Kid, Mmmghh...! ~~~Just tell him that you will ~~~Refuse
Kid," Serge, this is none of yer business. It's me own problem!"
Kid," OK, understood! But this ain't somethin' I can agree to on a whim."
Kid," I'll consider it. Until I settle the score with Lynx, that is. That's about the best I can promise. I can't guarantee you anythin' more."
Korcha," Alright, that's all I need for now. OK, I'll lend you the boat."
Kid," Glenn, what was it you were sayin' earlier? Somethin' 'bout goin' to see an old man on a small island to the east..."
Glenn," First, head north and then east by boat. There is a small island there. A retired dragoon named Radius lives on that island."
Kid, What was that Glenn guy sayin' earlier? Somethin' 'bout goin' to see an old man on a small island to the east...
Korcha," Hey, you be careful with yourself from now on. Just remember that your life is not just your own anymore. You're carrying my wife-to-be."
Kid, Brrrhh! (Goose bumps!!!)
Korcha, Do you want me to come with you? ~~~Take him with you ~~~Don't take him with you
Korcha," OK, then I'll be heading home now. Remember that I'm just LENDING you my boat! Don'tCHA dare sink it! Take care!"
System, Korcha joinedCHA party!
Kid, ...... This is getting bloody crazy...
Kid, Looks like we got Korcha to lend us his boat.
Korcha," Hey, wait a minute! She's your partner, ain't she? Aren'tCHA gonna do anything? ~~~...There's nothing we can do ~~~I'll find a way to save her"
Korcha," You scared me for a second... Heh, I've come this far, I'll tag along with ya!"
Korcha, ...Hold it right there.
Korcha, You've got no right to keep that girl's amulet. Leave that thing here.
Korcha, What's wrong? Hurry it up.
System, Serge handed over the Astral Amulet.
Korcha," Tsk, this is disgustin'. ...It's turnin' out to be a baaad day."
Korcha, What do you want? Ya need something from me? I don't want nothing to do with you. Get outta here.
Korcha, You've got something to say? ~~~I need to borrow your boat ~~~......
Korcha," Ha, it's got nothing to do with me. You're distracting me by standing there. Will ya hurry up and get out of the room?"
Korcha," Lend you my boat? Ha, no way! Why should I lend you my boat? Sorry, pal, go find someone else."
Macha, Hold it right there!!!
Korcha, M-M-Ma!!! Why are you here? You said you were goin' shoppin'!?
Korcha," O-Oh leave me alone! These guys ain't no friends of mine! In the first place, this has got nothing to do with you, ma. Why should I lend my boat to guys who abandon their own partners!?"
Korcha," Ugh...um, well..."
Korcha, S-Sorry about that... I just lost my temper.
Korcha," H-Hey, that's a completely different story, ma. I can't lend them my boat..."
Korcha," You say a boat or two, but... That's the only one I have. Besides, I've got nothin' to do with..."
Korcha, Oh gawd! You gotta be kiddin'...
Macha," I'll be waitin' at the docks. Call me when you're ready to leave the village. By the way, Serge.. You should go see the village shaman. You look like you are lost, and she might be able to help you get back on your path..."
Macha, Alrighty.
Macha," Oops, I almost forgot. I came back to get some things I left behind."
Macha," OK, Serge.. I'll be waiting for you at the docks."
Macha," OK, Serge.. Call me when you're ready to go. This isn't anything special, but go ahead and keep it. You know what frames are, right? This frame is called 'Tropical Paradise.'"
System,
Korcha, Don't get me wrong! I'm only lending you the boat because ma said to.
Macha," Serge, you haven't met the shaman yet? Oops... Sorry about that. I forgot to tell you where she is. All you need to do, is go straight down this way, get to the second floor and keep going left. That leads you down to the Dragon Shrine."
Macha, Are you ready? ~~~Not yet ~~~Ready
Macha," Is that so? Well, there's no rush. Just take your time."
Macha," OK then, let's get going. Alright boys and girls, all of you get on the boat!"
Macha," Hmm? You got a problem with that? Ya don't see any other boats needin' to dock, do you?"
Macha," Ah, cut the jive-talk!!!"
Macha," OK, we're in Termina. Do whatCHA need to do!"
Glenn," The general and his men are headed for Fort Dragonia. There has been word that the major power of the East, Porre, is up to something suspicious. They seem to have heard the rumors of the Frozen Flame in El Nido and are coming to investigate."
Woman," My, then that means the Porre army might invade this town any time now. I wonder if we will be alright..."
Glenn," Yes, that is why we are moving to the fort for a while. That fort is far from town so it is not used normally, but it has good defenses. I was ordered to remain at the manor and protect Miss Riddel, but... She felt very uneasy about the way General Viper was acting before he left, so..."
Woman, What are you going to do? Aren't you going to get in trouble if you leave the manor?
Glenn," Yes... Still, I cannot stop thinking about it, so I am planning to infiltrate the fort by boat."
Woman," Are you sure about that? If worse comes to worst, you might be discharged from the Acacia Dragoons."
Glenn," Yes. I will act in accordance with my faith, even if I have to break military regulations. I must go. Ma'am, I will come back to buy flowers from you when I return!"
Woman, Take care!
Macha," I'm gonna head home soon, but whatCHA gonna do now? I don't know what happened ten years ago or what's goin' on now, but don'tCHA wanna get things straight? Or do you just wanna go live somewhere in peace and quiet? ~~~Straighten things out ~~~Live quietly"
Macha," Hmm, well if you say so. There's nothing more for me to say about it. You don't have to make some epic journey to find happiness. But this ol' lady thinks you should have a little more adventure when you're young. You sure you wanna stop here? ~~~No, I'll set things straight! ~~~Yes, I'll live on quietly"
Macha," That a boy! I knew you wouldn't give up! Life is a journey to find yourself. That's how everyone grows up... So, where do we go to find out what's goin' on? What? So you say we need to go after Lynx and General Viper to Fort Dragonia?"
Macha," Did you hear? Fort Dragonia is a ruin of the extinct Dragonians... People say they conducted strange ceremonies, and most folks from Guldove won't go near the place... You gotta wonder what they're up to with the Dragon Tear there. It gives me the chills. Also, you've got to go through Mount Pyre to get to that fort. You're gonna need to get there by boat... ~!!!~"
Macha, I know! You can borrow this boat. Just a little farewell gift from me. Don't worry! That brat son o' mine's not gonna use it for anythin' good anyway!
System, Serge borrowed the boat from Macha!
Glenn, I need to borrow a boat...
Macha," Oops, you are just a tad too late. I just lent this boat to someone else. Ask this boy here."
Glenn, I need to borrow a boat... I am trying to get to Fort Dragonia.
Macha," Fort Dragonia!? Wow, what a coincidence! These boys have some business there, too!"
Glenn, You are... You are the young man that gave us the bellflower... Thank you again. Miss Riddel greatly appreciated your kindness.
Macha," You two already know each other? What great timing! On the road you need a companion, in life you need kindness. Join in with them on their trip to the fort."
Glenn, But what business brings you to Fort Dragonia...? And that red bandana... It all seems similar to some ghost Karsh was telling me about.
Macha," Ahh, you city-folk try to make things too complicated! That's got nothin' to do with you, right? This poor boy's got his own problems, too!!! Why don'tCHA ask him his story to pass time while you're travelling?"
Glenn," Uh, y-yes... I guess you are right."
Glenn, So what will it be? ~~~Let him join ~~~Don't let him join
Glenn," Thank you... I have a suggestion before heading to the fort. When we get on the boat, first head north and then east. You should find a small island there. A retired Master Knight of the Dragoons named Radius lives there now. When me and my big brother were young, he used to look after us quite often. We should go ask for his advice before going any further. There are many frightful rumors about that fort. Who knows what to expect there."
Macha," Serge.!!! Why are you tryin' to leave this poor boy out? Don'tCHA need all the help you can get right now? I mean, he even looks like a knight! Be a good boy, and take him with you!"
Glenn," Thank you... I have a suggestion before heading to the fort. When we get on the boat, first head north and then east. You should find a small island there. A retired Master Knight of the Dragoons named Radius lives there now. When me and my big brother were young, he used to look after us quite often. We should go ask for his advice before going any further. There are many frightful rumors about that fort. Who knows what to expect there."
System, Glenn joined your party!
Macha," I'm a little worried about you... Do you want me to come along? ~~~Let her join ~~~No, thanks"
System, Macha joinedCHA party!
Macha," Then I'll be headin' home. That mischievous son of mine's probably starving back home. Be careful out there. If you ever need something, stop by Guldove again!"
Woman," Just remember, Glenn, don't push yourself too hard. If you die, you'll never accomplish all those things you want to do."
System, Guile received Bronze Rod!
Nikki, I'll be gone for a while... But don't worry. I'll be back when the gig's over.
Nikki," I'll be gone for a while... Don't worry, man. I'll definitely come back when the gig's over."
Glenn, ...... Now...this brings back some memories.
Riddel, Looks like Dario took the championship after all.
Karsh," Ha! I almost had ya there, though. It won't be the same next year, Dario. Next time, I'll take the trophy!"
Dario," Haha, good luck, Karsh."
Karsh," What caught me by surprise this time was Glenn. Since when did he improve his skills so much? We've got to watch out for him next time. Ain't I right, Glenn?"
Glenn, ~!!!~
Karsh, Glenn? Waddaya doing?
Glenn," Oh, uh n-nothing! But wow, both Dario and Karsh are great! Compared to that, I've still got a long way to go to win."
Karsh, Weird kid... Don't worry. You'll be celebrating with the winner's trophy in no time!
Karsh," Well, maybe not while I'm still around, though!!! Hahaha!"
Riddel," What's with this big mouth of yours! Glenn, pay him no heed. Don't hold back!"
Karsh," Ah, come on. Lady Riddel is always on the brothers' side! Will ya come and be on my side once in a while?"
Riddel," Oh, but that's not true. I'm always cheering for the three of you. As long as you're all safe, I'm content. As long as it is peaceful, and we can all talk together like this... I wish that it would always be this way. That is my most deepest wish..."
Dario, ......
Glenn, Oops... Now is not the time to get sentimental...
Girl," Mr. Glenn! Can you help me? These two just won't stop fighting. Mr. Glenn, when you used to live here, you didn't fight, did you? Please, tell them to stop!"
Glenn," Ha ha ha! There is no such thing as brothers that do not fight with one another. Even we fought, sometimes. But, when Dario realized that he was at fault, he would always apologize to me later. You can fight, but you must learn something from it!"
Glenn," So, what are you fighting about?"
Glenn," Ha ha ha! There is no such thing as brothers that do not fight with one another. Even we fought, sometimes. But, when Dario realized that he was at fault, he would always apologize to me later. You can fight, but you must learn something from it!"
Glenn," So, what are you fighting about?"
Glenn, ...!?
Glenn, ...His bride?
Glenn," ...... Whoa, you two are mature for your ages. But have you asked Marina how she feels about it?"
Girl," H-How do I feel... Um, well... I like you both!"
Glenn," Marina, these two are serious. It is best if you tell them how you truly feel."
Glenn," Marina, these two are serious. It is best if you tell them how you truly feel."
Girl," Uh, ummm... Th-The one I really like is John, who's training outside to become a hero... But John already has a girlfriend, Annie, so..."
Glenn," ...This might be a bit hard to take, but I guess it can't be helped. But I guess it is better than her liking one of you more than the other..."
Girl, Huh...?
Glenn," Uh, ahem. Nevermind... Even if you do not marry one of them, try to get along with them, alright?"
Girl, Y-Yes... I'll do my best.
Glenn, Call me whenever you need help!
Macha," Welcome, Serge.. Call me whenever you need my help. If you want, I can help you right now! ~~~Thanks, maybe next time ~~~Please help me"
Macha," Then take care of yourself. Don'tCHA get in over your head, do you hear me?"
Macha," Right on, leave it to me! Nothing's more powerful than a mother's love!"
Macha, ...Ahh. My help isn't needed this time. Too bad.
Korcha," Oh, it's you guys again. Didja come by to laugh at me? Ha, what losers..."
System,
Glenn, What on earth happened!? Could Lynx have done this!?
Member, What happened here!? Did Lynx do this!?
Harle, Zat'z correct. Hmm... Maybe not?
Harle," Ze correct answer iz, I did zis under Monsieur Lynx's order."
Harle," Salut, Serge. Did you miss moi?"
Glenn, Harle!!! What have you done with Radius!?
Harle, Ooh lah lah... Glenn... You're all fired up.
Harle, Oooooooh...!
Glenn, Tell me!!!
Harle," Tsk, tsk, tsk!"
Harle," Excusez-moi, Serge, but do you want to know why I burned zis place to ze ground?"
System, ~~~Tell me ~~~Not really...
Harle," Ahh, oui? You are no fun."
Harle," Well, first of all to teach you all a lesson... And second of all to get rid of zat geezer who livez here. He iz an ally of ze Acacia Dragoonz, and I hear he'z quite skilled. I waz disappointed to see zat ze geezer izn't here. I wonder where he went?"
Harle," And one more t'ing, Serge. Monsieur Lynx gave moi one more order. Zat iz to slow down your pursuit."
Harle, Here I go!
Harle," Listen, Serge... I know very well zat you do not want to fight moi, but... It would save mon honneur if you fight moi here."
Harle," Let'z continue, oui? ~~~Fine ~~~Not yet"
Harle, Non!? Hurry up!
Harle, Bravo! Here I go!
Harle, Enfin... Take all ze time you wish.
Harle, Mon Dieu! Moi iz défaited!
Harle," Ooh lah lah... You really are strong, trés fort, Serge."
Harle," Well, zat'z all ze fun for today...!"
Harle," Au revoir, Serge."
Old Man, Are you one of Lynx's minions?
Glenn," Radius, you are safe!"
Radius," Hoh-hoh! Is that you, Glenn? It's been a while. You seem well."
Glenn, I am glad you are alright.
Radius, Yes... Miss Riddel had informed me that Lynx and the general were heading to Fort Dragonia. I played it safe and went into hiding for a while... And it looks like Lynx did pay me a visit. I'm sure the general has no idea what happened here. Lynx is the one behind all this.
Radius, I had a feeling something like this might happen... That is why I made sure to build a sturdy stronghold underground. I believe it should still be intact.
Glenn, Lynx must be plotting something.
Radius," By the way, Glenn... Who are these people?"
Glenn, Oh... They are...
Radius," Well, no sense standing out here. Please, come in."
Radius, I see... So you have met Miss Riddel and Glenn.
Radius, Hmmm... I see.
Radius," Yes, I once wielded a sword as a proud member of the Acacia Dragoons. Glenn's father, Garai, the blacksmith, Zappa, and I used to tear up the battlefield."
Radius," But that was a good fifteen years ago... When Garai lost his life on the central continent, I vowed to become his sons' guardian. I officially retired four years ago, after Dario received his father's sword, the Einlanzer. I have been here ever since, living a carefree life away from the rest of the world."
Radius," However, Dario is no longer with us... Life is so unpredictable..."
Radius," It was then that Lynx approached General Viper. He spoke of the legendary treasure, the Frozen Flame, which is able to heal all illnesses and fulfill any dreams."
Radius," I do not know what this man Lynx is plotting... But I believe General Viper intends to overthrow the nation of Porre with the power of this legendary flame. Porre is a nation governed by militarism and has brought on suffering to many people on the central continent of Zenan. Perhaps the general envisions a bright and peaceful world, much like Guardia was at one time..."
Radius, Or... Is he planning to find the answer as to why we have continued to hurt and kill each other since antiquity...?
Radius," In any case, I no longer wish to involve myself in any conflicts. Besides, there is no way I would want to face General Viper in battle. Young one, should you plan to engage in battle with Lynx, beware... He is a fearsome man."
Radius," I suggest you rest here for the night and leave in the morning. There are many cursed spirits wandering the seas around here. Rumor has it, they attack ships and suck the souls out of humans..."
Member, I've heard rumors about this accursed ghost ship...
Kid, What? A ghost ship? Hah! You tryin' to scare me!? Don't make me laugh.
Radius," Do not take the sea lightly, young lady. Mankind knows only but the land and the surface of the sea. No man can truly know what hides beneath the waves."
Radius, Take care of yourself.
Radius," Whatever lies ahead of you, believe in your friends, no matter what..."
System, Skelly became the life of your party!
Member, Could this be...
Member, The ghost ship?
Member," Well, what are we waiting for?"
Member, You're right... We won't be able to navigate our boat in this fog.
Serge, ???
Kid, Oi! Is this thing really a ghost ship...!?
Poshul, Thith doethn't rook rike a ghotht thhip to I...
Leena, Doesn't seem like a ghost ship to me...
Pierre," Ah, oui? Is this really a ghost ship?"
Nikki, Could this really be a ghost ship...?
Korcha, This ain'tCHA ordinary ghost ship...
Glenn, So this is the infamous ghost ship...?
Macha, Is this whatCHA call a ghost ship?
Doc, I sense human activity aboard this ship...
Luccia, Is dis a ghost ship? ...Highly illogical.
Fargo," Arg! Ya seem ta be a bit young for one of Lynx's subordinates. Well, who cares!?"
Member, What do you want from us!?
Fargo, That's up ta you...
Fargo, But first thing's first...
Fargo, What is yer intention?
Member, ???
Kid," That's a load of bull! We don't work for them! We're out to get 'em! Get in our way and I'll kick yer arse so hard, you'll kiss the moons!!!"
Poshul, We're not playing thtupid. Me have no idea what you're talking about.
Leena," No, no, no, you're mistaken. We're actually after them. They're our enemy! E-N-E-M-Y!"
Pierre," Non, non, non, non, non... You are very much mistaken. We are in pursuit of them."
Nikki, You surely don't believe that we are their allies?
Korcha," WhatCHA talkin' 'bout!? Since when are we on the same team as Lynx!? We're after them, OK!?"
Glenn," You do not have the facts straight. We, too, are in hot pursuit of Lynx. Do not hinder our mission to Fort Dragonia."
Macha, Can'tCHA see you're wrong? We're after them! Leave us alone!
Doc, It appears that you are mistaken. We are after them...
Luccia, Sigh... Dis is vhy it is so difficult dealing vith imbeciles like you.
Fargo, Huh? Are ya serious? Explain yerselves.
Fargo, I see... So that explains why you're after Lynx.
Fargo, But... Don't ya know you're riskin' yer lives? Don't ya recognize the danger associated with Lynx? He's a monster... A cold-blooded monster... An incarnation of death...
Fargo," To be frank with ya, we've had our share of encounters with Lynx, too. But that was a long time ago... Ever since then, we've had ta disguise ourselves as this ghost ship."
Fargo," So you're gonna face Lynx, eh...? That's easy to say, but..."
Kid, Cut the crap and get to the point!!!
Poshul, Tho what'th your point?
Leena, But what...!? Huh!?
Luccia, Speak your mind.
Member, What are you getting at?
Fargo, Arg! Bring out our you-know-what!
Fargo, I just wanna see if you youngsters can match up to the likes of Lynx. Just makin' sure you're not all talk.
Fargo, Looks like they're ready. Let's see what you can do!
Fargo, Just loosenin' ya up! Time ta get serious!!!
Fargo, What? They're not worthy enough opponents for ya!?
Fargo, Polly!!!
Fargo, Arg! Are ya just playin' with me!?
Fargo, Arg... Stronger than I expected. You got me blood boilin'.
Fargo, I'm next!!!
Fargo, Jolly ho! Up and at 'em!
Fargo, Now that smarts...!
Fargo," Not bad... But keep in mind, we be pirates!"
Fargo, Hah! You're pretty good at runnin' from fights!
Serge, ???
Member, Serge!!!
Fargo," Well, that's that! Arg! Stick these land- lubbers in the hold!"
Member," Are you alright, Serge? You don't look so well."
Member, Be on your guard. There's something going on outside.
Member, Something's up...
Member, What are these monsters doing here? What's going on?
Kid, Ya think the almighty Kid would go down that easy!?
Kid," Anyways, what the bloody hell is goin' on here!?"
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU! Piece of cake!
Poshul," By the way, what ith going on here?"
Leena," Oh, they were nothing against the likes of us!"
Leena," So, what was that thing? What's going on?"
Pierre," Ahh la lah! Please, I am not a weakling like you...!"
Pierre," Tell us what's going on here, oui?"
Nikki, Heh... Easier than playing the bass.
Nikki," By the way, what's going on?"
Korcha, Don'tCHA realize we're a cut above the rest?
Korcha," By the way, what's goin' on, here?"
Glenn, My dragoon training is a lot harder than that.
Glenn, Do tell me... What is happening here?
Macha, CHA-HA-HA! They're no match for us!
Macha, But what's goin' on here? Don'tCHA know?
Doc," That was not nearly sufficient to bring us down, dude."
Doc," By the way, what is your prognosis of this situation?"
Luccia, My being here vill be pointless if ve are defeated.
Luccia, By the vay... Vot is going on here?
Member, We don't go down that easily.
System, There's a note... 'Key duty is a big responsibility!'
System, It's locked...
System, Serge borrowed the 'key.'
System, Serge borrowed the 'key.'
System," Serge received the 'key.' Did ya find the key? Oh good. You should be able to make yer way to the deck with that. Please help out Cap'n Fargo. Uhhh... I'm on key duty, but with all this chaos, I...uhhh... gave it to the nearest matey around me. I was in such a panic, I don't quite remember who I gave it to. I'm sure he's downstairs... somewhere..."
System, Used 'key!'
System, Pip joined your party!
System, Pip forced his way into your party!
Fargo, Arg! You call yerselves sea-dogs!? Show some spirit!!! Huh!?
Fargo, Get yer... stinkin'... ghostly hands...
Fargo, OFF ME...!!!
Fargo, ARG!!! Looks like we got a big one comin'!
Fargo," (Damn, me arm...)"
Fargo," Yer name's Serge, eh!? Go take the wheel!"
System," ~~~Aye-aye, Cap'n! ~~~But I've never done it before"
Fargo, I'm countin' on ya!
Fargo," No time ta fuss! When I tell ya to do it, YOU DO IT!!!"
Fargo," Keep yer heads high, mateys! Don't forget we be pirates aboard the S.S. Invincible!!! Man yer stations! It's time ta show these monsters what we're made of!!!"
Nikki, The name of this ship is the S.S. Invincible...!? Then... That means...!
Fargo, Serge!!! Keep yer head high! They're comin'!!!
Fargo," Huh!? I can't believe you would flee! Get it together, matey! Get back on the wheel once you equip yerselves!"
Fargo, Looks like the sea's back to normal...
Fargo, You said you were headin' to Fort Dragonia to go after Viper and his men.
Fargo, Let me give ya some advice.
Fargo," Mount Pyre is a fiery hell. Without any protection against fire, you'll lose strength fast. I suggest ya go see the Water Dragon for his divine protection."
Fargo, Although I haven't heard much about him recently. I wonder if that dragon's
Fargo," Actually... I haven't heard much about the other dragons, either."
Fargo, And those monsters we just beat... What's goin' on nowadays...?
Fargo," ...... I tell ya, even the sea seems ta have changed its nature..."
Fargo, It's probably because we human folks have come around...
Kid, Yeah...yeah... I don't need this mushy talk from a pirate.
Poshul, It racks perthuathiveneth when thaid by a pirate.
Leena, Hee... Didn't think pirates had a sentimental side.
Pierre," Ahh la lah... I comprendre what you're saying, but coming from a pirate..."
Nikki, ...... Please...not from a pirate.
Korcha, Don'tCHA know you're a pirate? Why get all sentimental?
Glenn, I never thought I would hear something like this from a pirate.
Macha, WhatCHA talkin' about? I thought you were a pirate?
Doc," Hah haha... That is quite interesting, coming from a pirate-dude."
Luccia, Vhy must I hear dis from a pirate?
Fargo, In the name of Davy Jones... What have we done...?
Nikki, Do you... have any children?
Fargo, Huh? What kind of question is that...?
Fargo," Children, eh...? Yeah, I do. But it may be more appropriate to say I did..."
Fargo," I had two children, but they both died... That was long, long ago..."
Fargo," If my son were still alive today... why, he'd be 'bout yer age..."
Nikki, I'm sorry...
Fargo," Hah! Don't worry 'bout it, matey. That was a long time ago. But...why do ya ask?"
Nikki," I-It's nothing... I just felt like asking, that's all..."
Fargo," ...... Well, alright. Take care of yerself."
Fargo," Ahoy, mateys! Make yerselves at home."
Girl,
Member, ...What's going on? Where's Kid...? Don't tell me she...
Member, Serge... It's not your fault...
Kid, ...What're you guys all doin' there?
Kid," Oi, it's been a while, eh? But what's with the astonished look on yer faces?"
Kid," Huh, what? Where was I? Oh, I complained about this sissy gown, but then they hid me own clothes somewhere to stop me from tryin' to escape..."
Kid," So I had no choice but to take a walk around the village lookin' like this. Anyway, what's up with you guys? Didja come back because you were worried about me?"
Kid," Heh, I ain't gonna drop dead from such a weako poison like that...! But, I guess it was a pretty close call this time, eh... Hehe."
Member, But how did you neutralize the poison?
Kid," Sorry, I haven't the foggiest idea, either. The doc will be back this afternoon, so let's ask him then."
Doc, You are here to ask me how I was able to neutralize the poison?
Kid," ...Yeah. There's nothing to lose by knowing how, right Doc?"
Doc," It was a coincidence... No, it was probably an act of fate. After you left the village, a young man came to visit me upon hearing of the patient's condition from a villager. He had brought a certain item with him."
Member, A certain item? You don't mean...?
Doc," Yes, it was Hydra Humour. He happened to have a vial of it with him at the time..."
Kid," Hey doc, who was that guy? Do you at least know his name?"
Doc, I am sorry. I do not know... He only told me that he 'came from the mainland.'
Kid," ...Came from the mainland? Tsk! At least give me a chance to thank him! Sheeze! I hate being in debt to others! Ah, hell! When I find him I'll...!? Wait, that's not what I wanna do."
Doc," That is all that I know. In the end, I proved useless as a doctor. It is not something that could be forgiven, but I offer my apologies..."
Kid," Hey, wait doc. What's with the formality? No matter what else happened, you're the one that made the antidote, right? It would've been useless without you, even if we did have the right stuff."
Doc," ...Thank you, Kid."
Kid," Oi, stop that. I'm the one that should be thankin' you. No worries, doc! Well, the only thing that bugs me is the guy that brought that...humour, was it?"
Kid," Hehe... I guess I caused you blokes a heap of trouble, too!"
Kid," Hey, don't worry. I'm no good at this... But thanks."
Doc," So, what are you dudes planning to do next? Do you intend to continue on your journey?"
Kid," That's right, we've still got things to take care of. We'll be leaving by tomorrow. Serge has got a lot of problems that need to be solved..."
Doc, Then will you allow me to join in your party? I would like to broaden my horizons as a doctor... Will I be too much of a nuisance to you?
Kid," Whoa, having a doctor with us will be a great help! Besides, how can I turn down a request from me lifesaver. We're more than happy to have you with us!"
System," ~Doc joined your party, dude!"
Doc, ...Thank you kindly. It has gotten late and I need to make preparations. It would probably be better if we leave tomorrow. Please rest here for the night.
Kid," ...I see. So that's what's been goin' on while I was snoozin' away here. You say Viper and his mob are headed for Fort Dragonia, heh?"
Kid," Didja hear? Fort Dragonia's the oldest ruin that the Dragonians left on this planet. From what I hear, we need the 'Dragon Tear' to activate the fort."
Kid," Don't ya remember, Serge? It's that blue orb that was on A blue orb... ~~~Was there such a thing? ~~~Yes, I remember"
Kid," What, you don't remember? Gawd you're hopeless..."
Kid," Great, so I don't have to waste me breath explaining it then..."
Kid," If I ain't mistaken, that orb was probably the Dragon Tear. Which means that it's in the hands of old Viper right now."
Glenn, ...I cannot believe it! The general has the Dragon Tear... But why?
Member, Then General Viper plans to...
Kid," ...To activate the ruin. There's no doubt about that. In any case, we can't just sit back and let this happen."
Glenn, An impenetrable fortress surrounded by rough terrain... And I hear it is also sealed by the powers of the Dragonians. Is the general trying to stop the Porre military with it...?
Member, This must have something to do with the recent actions of Porre. A fortress surrounded by rough terrain and sealed by the powers of the Dragonians... Is the general going to start a war with Porre?
Kid," Even I don't know that, but I wouldn't say that it's not a possibility..."
Member," Then we must head to Fort Dragonia. Unfortunately, Mount Pyre is a rugged obstacle that lies on the path to the fort. From what I've heard, the place is a fiery hell. Trying to cross the mountain unprepared will be hard going.."
Member, Come to think of it... that captain said we should obtain the divine protection of the Water Dragon...
Member, But the water source of Water Dragon Isle has run dry. Even the fairies said that the Water Dragon is no longer in this w.orld...
Member, ...Does that mean we have to climb Mount Pyre on our own?
Member," Rumor has it, the water source has dried up due to abnormal weather..."
Member, The chances of the Water Dragon being on the island are slim...
Member," So, in the worst case, we have to climb Mount Pyre on our own?"
Kid," Dragons, eh...? This is gettin' bigger by the minute. But I think this problem can be easily taken care of!"
Member, What do you mean by that?
Kid," Serge, you hold the key to our problems."
Kid," You heard the story from the village shaman, right? The story about the 'Land of Genesis.'"
Member," Kid, are you talking about the other world...? the world where Serge came from?"
Kid," Yeah, that's right. The situation in each world is different, right? Things missing in one world can be found in the other. If that's true, then we still stand a chance!"
Member, But how are we going to get to the other world?
Kid, My amulet...
Member, Amulet?
Kid," Yeah, my Astral Amulet. It's the other key to solving our problem."
Kid," I don't know if you've heard from the shaman, but you need lots of power to cross the dimensions. She said it was something about the powers of hope and will."
Kid," According to the shaman, this amulet has that sort of power. Normally, I would've just thought she was crazy, but this time, maybe I oughta listen to her."
Kid," This amulet alone ain't enough to cross dimensions, though. We need the other key to make the connection between this world and the other world."
Member, A connection... So you're saying that Serge is this key?
Kid," According to the shaman, that's right... Someone that's not supposed to be in this world that's the link to a world that was severed 10 years ago... The missing piece of the puzzle."
Kid," That's the lowdown. The rest is up to you, Serge. We need to first get that 'divine protection' or whatever from the Water Dragon."
Kid," Well, I don't know about you, but... I probably don't need no Dragon's protection to get me through hot water! But that's me..."
Kid," We gotta head to the 'Land of Genesis.' The place where this all began! Only you know where that is. Before we go, I'll leave this in yer keeping for a while. But, don't ya dare lose it on me! Serge received the Astral Amulet."
Kid," Alright, let's go to the place where this all began!"
System, Kid has rejoined your party! Kid joined your party!
Doc, There is still much to be learned in this world...
Member, So this is the dimensional gate...
Member, Then let's get going!
Kid," Opassa Beach... Yeah, so this is it... The point of contact, and the starting point... This is the 'Cross Point.'"
Kid," What do you expect us to do now, mate?"
Kid," An open seam to the world... A wormhole that traverses dimensions... The world's callin' you, Serge... Callin' the lost piece of the puzzle..."
Kid, An open seam to the world... A dimensional wormhole... The world's callin' the lost piece of the puzzle...
Kid, Hah! That was it!?
Kid," We're in that other world now, right? That wasn't such a big deal."
Old Man," Uhhh... Ughhh......? Oh, it's you, Serge. Great day, huh? How's your day been? What was that...? You want me to take you to Water Dragon Isle? Well, it's not too far, so I'm willin' to take you there for 100G. ~~~Forget it ~~~Yes, take me! OK. Call on me anytime you want to get off the island. As you can see, I don't have much to do. Huaaaaaaaah... Hey, you don't have enough. I'm sorry but I can't take you there for free. Serge paid 100G. Great! Shall we get going? There we go."
Old Man," Hoho, it's been a while since I visited this isle, but its beauty never fades. But there's something strange... I don't see any of the fairies that usually dance around the pond. Oh, pardon me. There's a small village of fairies on this isle. It should be just beyond this pond. I don't know what brings you to this isle, but it's best to ask the fairies to learn about the place. In the meantime, I'll be 'round here fishing. This pond is great for fishing. Going back to the village already? ~~~Not yet ~~~Head back Give me a holler when you're through. You got that, Serge? Okey-dokey, then let's head back, shall we? I know it's not that far, but going there and back is a lot of work for an old man like me. Ho, ho...oh, don't mind it. I'll just keep fishing as long as I'm here. Going back to the village already? ~~~Not yet ~~~Head back"
System, We can't let them get away with this. We have to save the fairies!
Member," Urr, we can't get away from this one! This isn't good, Serge..."
Member, ..Serge. We're not finished yet. It's too early to go outside.
Member," Let's go, Serge. The Water Dragon is just beyond here... We've to finish what we came here for."
Member, Serge! There is a fairy over there... ...Serge. Is it alright?
Member, I don't feel their presence in the caves anymore... I am sure it's safe outside as well.
Member," We're sorry, but wait right here for a minute... We need to go further into the cave. It will only be a little while..."
Member," That forest is not yet dead. The Hydra is not yet extinct. She had a whelp, even though it was still only an infant. The forest is still alive and will continue to thrive."
Member, ...Razzly. Is she your big sister?
Member," ...!? Tsk, if only we had gotten here a little earlier..."
System, There's no answer... It's already passed away.
Member," Wait, Serge. We've come so far, we can't turn back now."
Member," Serge, there's something that looks like a monument back there. That must be what we're looking for."
System, Member has been bestowed the Ice Breath.
System, Razzly received Wisp Cape.
System, Razzly... are you really going?
Kid," ...Where am I? I fainted, eh?"
Kid, Sorry... Did I wake you up? I had a bad dream.
Kid, Seein' that fairy's eyes filled with tears over losin' her friends... That must've triggered memories of me own past.
Kid, I was an orphan... I was abandoned when I was a baby...
Kid, There was someone who took me in and raised me as if I were her own little sister... I'm alive here today thanks to her.
Kid," There were a lot of others like me at Sis's place, and... she was always makin' strange stuff... We didn't have money, but we were all happy."
Kid," Up until that Lynx bastard... came and shattered our happiness to pieces! Lynx raided our house, burned it down, and kidnapped Sis!"
Kid, Sister... never came back...
Kid," Since then, I've wandered the world and experienced so much pain, just to get by... No one was there to help me. I was always alone. If you ask me, the idea of guardian angels watchin' over us all the time... that's a load of rubbish."
Kid," In this world, the underhanded always gets the last laugh. Only the ones who don't think anything of hurtin' others are the ones who get blood- stained fortunes. The ones who kill, the ones who devour, they're the ones who survive. That's the only rule of this world."
Kid," The great species of mankind... our wonderful world, filled with love and happiness... HA! Don't make me laugh!"
Kid," But if that's how it is, that's fine with me. As long as I'm alive, there ain't no goin' back. I'll abide by this world's rules, and do what I gotta do, despite the rotten hand of cards I've been dealt!"
Kid, I'll make sure that bloody bastard pays for what he's done!!! I will get even...! No matter what it takes!!!
Member, Huh? What's going on? The old boatman's gone!
Member, Did he head back to the village because we were so late?
Old Man," I figured you'd be coming back, so I set the boat out. Are you all safe? Oh, many pardons. It didn't look like you'd be coming back before sunset, and I had to return before it got dark. Well, since you made it back here, I guess you did what you needed to do? ...But you guys look a little gloomy for it to have gone well... No second thoughts? Then let's head back to the village. ~~~Can't go back yet ~~~Let's head back to the village Then I guess I'll wait here a little longer... ...You sure? Then let's go back to the village."
Acacia Dragoon," Our orders were to stand guard, but Glenn went off on his own. Huh? Glenn!!! What are you doing!?"
Glenn, I will be accompanying these people for an extended period.
Acacia Dragoon," Hmmm... Well, fine... Good luck."
Doc," ...Hola, dudes. Did you come back to see the patient again?"
Doc," I am sorry, but you are too late. She is no longer in the village. She has gone on alone."
Member, Gone on alone...? Do you mean that Kid has died...!?
Doc," Whoa, whoa, do not jump to conclusions. She is alive and well! The poison has been completely neutralized."
Member, ...What? So Kid's alright?
Doc," Shortly after you left, a young traveler who happened to have Hydra Humour visited the village. Thanks to him, we were able to save her life... After the poisoning was neutralized, she waited a few days for you."
Doc, But it appears it wasn't in her nature to wait. She left a few days ago on a merchant ship that stopped by the village.
Member, I see...Kid has recovered safely.
Doc," Yes, she is indeed healthy. I believe I told you this before, but the tides in the El Nido seas are tough to cross. Unless you are on a large vessel, it is impossible to leave the El Nido Archipelago. You will probably run into her again somewhere in El Nido."
Doc," She was searching for someone. Who she sought, I do not know... But since you were traveling with her, maybe you know who she was looking for?"
Doc, That is all that I can say. Good luck and try not to take too many risks.
Solt, AHHHHHH! They're really here!
Peppor," Th-This time, let's shake it to them for sure!"
Solt," Y-Yes. I'll do my best, Peppor!"
Peppor, Let's shake it.
Peppor, Get ready...!
Solt, To shake it...! As Peppor would say.
Solt," This time we shall not be beaten! I shall blow them to pieces with one of those powerfully powerful Elements you bought me, Peppor!"
Peppor, You mean one of those \'\Summoning Elements?\'\ Now we're shaking!
Solt," How tragically tragic!!! I hate to tell you this Peppor, but... I just remembered that I lost the Summoning Element I had with me!"
Peppor," ......!? What do you mean, you \'\lost\'\ it? Don't tell me you dropped it or your dog ate it or some other stupid excuse like that! You're asking for a darn good shaking if you do!"
Solt," No...I'm not that stupidly stupid, you know, Peppor! Actually, if you must know... that centipede monster in the Hydra Marshes stole it from me! And I was enjoying that excitingly exciting expedition in the marshes up till then, too...!"
Peppor," What do you mean, a centipede monster stole your Element??? What, he snuck up behind you and picked all your pockets with his hundreds of legs or something...?"
Solt," No Peppor... When I say stole, I don't mean he picked my pockets or anything like that! I mean he took it from me by laying a \'\Trap Element\'\ in which my Element got caught!"
Peppor, What in spice's name are you talking about? Would you kindly explain to me what a shaking Trap Element is.
Solt," Well... Errrh... It's difficultly difficult to explain in words, Peppor, so I will give you a demonstration... I will lay a Trap in front of you, Peppor, and then get you to use one of your special Elements."
Peppor, Alright. Let's give it a go...
Solt," 10-4, Peppor!"
Solt," Now, you see how I took your Element there, Peppor? I used a Trap Element designed exclusively to capture \'\BlackHole\'\ Elements! You see...each Trap Element only works on one kind of Element. They can't capture any Elements other than the ones they were designed to capture!"
Peppor," Shaking! Hmmm... I see what you mean about having your Summoning Element stolen there... Alright, now I understand. So you can give me back my BlackHole Element now!"
Solt, Oops! I should have told you. I can't give it back to you. You can't get that Element back again unless another monster is silly enough to have its Element captured...
Peppor," Huh......? Well, I guess it doesn't matter, seeing as you've got your hands on it now... So...why don't you hurry on up and use that Element you just trapped on the enemy! Come on... what are you waiting for...? Huh......?"
Solt, You know you can't use an Element until you have equipped it properly! So we'll have to wait until after this battle is over before we can re-equip it and use it! ...... Oops!
Peppor, ...W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W- W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY!?! WHY THE HELL DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SO DAMNED STUPID? THAT DOES IT!!! YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL SHAKING NOW!
Solt," Aaaaah! I'm sorrily sorry, Peppor! Please don't hit me... too hard!"
Solt," They ran away, Peppor!"
Peppor, O-Our day of victory has finally come.
Solt, Our days of disgracingly disgrace and shamefully shame are finally over!
Peppor, R-Right. It's time for us to shake our days of glory!
Peppor, Yeah? We'll just give you another quick shake down!
Solt," That's right, Peppor!"
Peppor, S-Shake it outta here!!!
Solt, P-Peppoooooor!
Member, What's that? It looks stuck.
Karsh," So you made it this far, huh, junior?"
Karsh," HAH! In the name of the Acacia Dragoons, you ain't gettin' past here!!!"
Member, Acacia Dragoons? Step aside.
Glenn, Karsh!?
Karsh," Huh? Is that you, Glenn!?"
Karsh," Huh? Is that you, Luccia!? What are doin' here with these guys?"
Karsh," And... You're with Luccia! Hey, hey, hey! What the hell is goin' on here!!!?"
Karsh, Why are you with these bozos!? HUH!?
Glenn," Please, Karsh, we need to get through. I need to see... I need to see for myself what is happening! Even if that means leaving the dragoons..."
Karsh, HAH! You call yourself a dragoon!?
Karsh," Luccia, what the hell are you doin' here?"
Luccia, Being a dragoon is no concern of mine. I only act according to my own personal motives. You understand?
Luccia, I only act according to my own personal motives. You understand?
Karsh," Hah! Yeah, I'm sure. You are a selfish one."
Karsh," HAH!? Sure, yeah, I get it. You are a selfish one."
Karsh," But...!!! In the name of the Acacia Dragoons, you ain't gettin' past here!!!"
Zoah, THIS WILL BE THE END OF YOU ALL.
Marcy," I don't care about you, Glenn!"
Marcy, I don't care about Glenn or Luccia!
Marcy," I don't care about you, Luccia!"
Marcy," And Serge!!!!!! I HATE YOU!!!!!! I hate your friends, your mom, your dad, your grandma, your grandpa, your great-grandma, your... I HATE THEM ALL!!!!!! I hate you! I despise you! I REALLY, REALLY ABHOR YOU!!!!!!"
Karsh, Gah hah hah! Looks like she can't stand you.
Karsh," Well, then... It's time for you to die!!!"
Karsh," What the hell, guys!? You all talk or somethin'!?"
Karsh," What happened? I thought you went crying home to mommy? Now, die!"
Karsh," Gah hah hah! Run, you cowards! Run! Run for your lives!"
Karsh," You enjoy pain? Eat this! Hiyaaah! Die, fiends, die!"
Marcy, I hate you! I abhor you!! Drop dead!!! You get me sooo angry! Hurry up and die! Why you!!!
Karsh, I-Impossible... There's no way I'd lose!?
Zoah," Karsh, IT IS ALMOST TIME."
Karsh, Dammit! I'll get even for this!
Marcy," NahÌ, nahÌ, na-na-nahÎ...!!!"
Harle, Serge...
Harle," If you proceed any further, zere will be no turning back, non? Even so... You still wish to go, Serge? ~~~Keep going ~~~Give up now"
Harle, I see... I won't stop you. But... Don't die...
Harle," I know you are lying... But, merci... Just don't die..."
Kid," C'mon, mate!!!"
Member, Come on!!!
Lynx, Finally... We've been expecting you.
Viper," I have nothing personal against you, but anyone who hinders our plan must be eliminated. I am rather sorry about that..."
Glenn, General...! What is going on here?
Viper," Glenn... This need not concern you now. One day, you will understand..."
Glenn, ......!
Viper, There is nowhere to run!!!
Viper, Hah hah hah... You are a worthy opponent... But let us see how you do now. I shall give it my all...
Viper, L You......traitor......!
Lynx," You were extremely useful in helping me make my way around these islands. I appreciate your help, General. However, I no longer have any need for you. This fort shall serve as a fine grave marker for you and your dragoons. May you rest in peace."
Viper, D-Damn...! Forgive Riddel......
Lynx," Now, let this be your final resting place as well."
Member, Kid...!!!
Member, Kid...!?
Member, You're alive!!!
Kid, I told ya I have more lives than a cat! No time for chit-chat! Hold yer sea horses!!!
Kid," You ain't gettin' away with what you did, Lynx!!!"
Lynx, Heh...
Kid," C'mon, Lynx!!! You're goin' down!"
Lynx, Huh...! Pathetic...
Lynx, You're more trouble than I thought... But do you really think your skills are superior to mine?
Kid, Sore loser!!!
Lynx," Serge, have you ever questioned who you really are?"
Kid, Serge...!?
Lynx," What has been the significance of your existence up until now? On that ominous day 10 years ago, the boundary of space and time was torn, and part of me, in fact, died..."
Lynx," You cannot defeat me, Serge... This is because denying me is the same as erasing your very existence."
Kid," Don't be taken in by his rubbish, Serge!!! This guy's full of it!"
Lynx, Huh... We'll see about that. There are two sides to every coin. Life and death...... Love and hate...... They are all the same.
Kid," What'd you say!? Talk some sense, will ya!"
Kid, Serge! What's wrong!?
Kid, LYNX!!! What have you done to Serge!?
Kid, Serge! You alright!?
Serge," Yes... I'm fine... I'm just fine, Kid."
Serge," What are you doing, Lynx? Now's your chance, Kid! Kill him!!!"
Kid, Yeah... I know.
Kid," This is the end of you, Lynx!!! Say yer prayers!"
Kid," There's no escape, Lynx!!!"
Serge," You did it, Kid."
Kid, Y-Yeah...
Kid, Y-Yeah... I showed him...
Serge, Now finish him. What's wrong? Settle it once and for all.
Kid, ......
Serge," Here, hand me your dagger. I'll finish him off."
Serge," Kid, you're injured... Here, hand me your dagger. I'll finish him off."
Serge," Watch this, Kid... I'll avenge Lucca for you! Die, LYNX!"
Kid, WAIT!!!
Serge," What, Kid? He's your foe, isn't he?"
Kid, ...... How do you know Lucca's name?
Serge," ......? What are you talking about, Kid...?"
Kid," Not once did I ever mention Lucca's name to you, Serge..."
Serge, ......!!!
Kid, No... Don't tell me you're...!?
Member, Serge... Why...!?
Serge, QUIET!!!
Serge," You, too!!!"
Member, ......!? N-Noooooo...!
Serge," This is the end of the road for you, Kid."
Kid, U-Ugh...! Y-You're Lynx... ain't ya!?
Lynx, Heh heh heh...! I'll send you to see Lucca.
Lynx, I'll finish you off later.
Lynx," Look at yourself, Serge... I mean, Lynx! Heh heh heh... Excellent! The enmity is growing! The only thing pure in this world is enmity! Well then, the time has come for the curtain to fall. Your services are no longer needed. Even your very existence is worthless... Farewell, Serge."
Lynx," Finally, I have the key. The key to the gate of Fate! The time has finally come for the Frozen Flame to awaken!!!"
Lynx," Come to the Sea of Eden, Serge... Should you wish to end your dream of 10 years ago... Now, let love bleed! Darker and deeper than the seas of hell! Heh heh heh...! HAH HAH HAH HAAAH...!"
System, Sprigg joined ya party!
Harle," You are très late, non? Come on, Monsieur Lynx, let'z go. We don't have ze time to be dawdling here. We may truly get lost in time. I can't afford to lose you just yet. ~~~I'm not Lynx...! ~~~Am I Lynx...?"
Harle, You are no longuer Serge. You are Monsieur Lynx.
Harle, Exactement. You are now Monsieur Lynx. You are no longuer Serge.
Harle," Allons, regarde-toi! Just look at yourself... Who in zeir right mind iz going to believe you are Serge? C'est simple. If everybody, except for yourself, sayz zat you are Monsieur Lynx...zen..."
Harle," Voilà! You are Monsieur Lynx! It'z az simple az zat. Zat iz who you are! C'est la réalité! If you try and go against réalité... Réalité will surely crush you. Réalité will kill you. And réalité will continue to go on az if not'ing ever happened... From yesterday to today, and from today to tomorrow. Réalité marchez on... Leaving your crushed body behind... ~~~But I'm Serge! ~~~I'm...Lynx...?"
Harle," Ooh la lah... So, you still insist zat you are Serge, oui?"
Harle," Bravo, c'est exact. You are Monsieur Lynx..."
Harle, Regarding your mémoire az zis Serge... You may be able to rewrite it if you use ze Dragon Tear.
Harle," In réalité, you died 10 yearz ago in ze other world. How can you say for sure zis iz ze real you?"
Harle," Maybe for you it is évident, but... I wonder if you ever really were Serge...?"
Harle," Furthermore... what waz zis Serge? A figure, a shape? A spirit? A soul? Where waz zis Serge?"
Serge, Who am... I? Who are... you? You're not me. I'm not you. I am reality... You are...
Harle," How boring... Fine, I understand how you feel. Let'z head back to reality."
System, Harle joined your partie!
Harle," We are back to réalité. Doez zis place look familiar to you, Monsieur Lynx? Do you need moi to tell you where we are? ~~~No, I already know ~~~Yes, tell me"
Harle," Ahhh, you remember. Then let'z leave zis forest marshez at once."
Harle," Tsk, tsk, tsk... You don't remember? We are very close to your home. We are in ze Hydra Marshes. You remember now, non? Although I do not know if ze Hydra still existz."
Harle," Listen, old lady... You are not getting any younger. Try to control your emotionz. And zere iz absolument no time to be partying! We must hurry along."
Harle," Ooh, Monsieur Lynx... You seem worried about zat Serge character. Do you still remember? Ze place where it all started... 'Where Angelz Lose Zeir Way'..."
Harle, A gate to anodder world...... Somet'ing like zat.
Harle," Leave zat up to Monsieur Lynx. Let'z just get going! But first, we must leave zis forest."
System, The distortion has disappeared...
Harle, Of course it won't open. Ze missing piece to zis world haz been found. Zere iz not'ing we can do. You are now just an unwanted piece.
Member, It's no use... Not matter how many times we try.
Member, Let's get going. There's nothing we can do here.
Old Man, ......!? Huh!? Demi-humans...!? What do you monsters want from us!?
Harle," Excusez-moi, geezer! What kind of attitude iz zat!? I will kick your derrière to ze moon, if you talk to mon Lynx comme ça!"
Old Man, Arghhh...!!! FREAK...!
Leena, AHHH!!! W-Who are you...?
Leena, WHAT!? Serge!? No... That's a lie!!! W-What the heck is going on!?
Leena," I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. How am I supposed to believe you're Serge when you look like that...? I'm sorry."
Leena, I still don't believe you. You can't just show up looking like that and say you're Serge...
Leena, Nothing you show me will change my mind. Sorry.
Harle," Well...? What shall you do, Monsieur Lynx? Nobody in your village believez zat you are Serge."
Harle," Hmmm... I see... Serge would do zat for you...? If zat iz ze case, zen you are safe. No one will be able to hurt you."
Radius, Are you the ones everybody is talking about?
Radius, No...this can't be... Are you Lynx!? You're still alive...!?
Radius," Step outside, Lynx! For I, too, was once a valiant member of the Acacia Dragoons! I must put a stop to you!"
Harle," Lah-la-la... Geezer, I wouldn't show off like zat. Zat iz if you want to live... Do not underestimate ze power of Monsieur Lynx. One blow and it'z off to ze other world wit' you!"
Radius, Silence! Now step outside!
Radius, Halt! We haven't settled anything!
Radius, Prepare yourselves!
Radius, En garde!
Radius, I stand defeated!
Radius, Hmmm...!? I do not sense any malice in your attacks...
Radius, Do you really mean to tell me that you are not Lynx? And is it true that the general is still active in the other world...?
Radius," Here, the general has been missing for the past 3 years now..."
Radius, Understood! I shall accompany you! We may still have a chance to save the general and Riddel in the other world.
Harle, Zut! This geezer iz only going to get in ze way...
System, Radius joined your party!
Radius," First, we must head to Termina... and gather news about General Viper's disappearance from this world. Don't worry, we will find a clue to return to the other world."
Radius," We must gather news in Termina, about General Viper's disappearance. We may find clues to show us how to return to the other world. I, Radius, shall give it my all, in the name of General Viper!"
Porre Soldier, Y-Yo... Check out that guy's face! Way...scary...!
Porre Soldier, Our investigation is done. Let's get the hell outta here!
Porre Soldier, I wanna go back to Porre!!!
System, It won't budge.
Member, Sorry... I know! Why don't you join us? The Frozen Flame should be able to change you back to normal.
System, Funguy joined your party.
Porre Soldier, !!! Lynx!!! H-How dare you have the nerve to return to this town! Get out of here!
Radius," Looks like the young 'un's an unwanted guest here, too."
Member," It looks like you're an unwanted guest here, too."
Harle," Humanz are very selfish, non? To t'ink th1at th1ey used to bow th1eir headz down to curry favor wit' Monsieur Lynx! th1ey're alwayz searching for someone or somet'ing to lay zeir blame on."
Porre Soldier," ......!!! Can it be you, Sir Lynx!? You are safe, sir? Where have you been all this time...!? We have set up a temporary military dock beyond this point. Nobody may pass without permission from Commander Norris...not even you, Sir Lynx. Commander Norris is at the ruins of Viper Manor. Please report your current status to him immediately!"
Van, ~!!!~
Van, At least knock before you enter!
Van," Are you guys tourists? If you want, I'd be willing to guide you around. Of course, there's a small fee involved. I think it's a bargain. How about it? ~~~Hire him ~~~Don't hire him"
Van," Is that so? Oh well, it's your loss."
Van, You got it!
Van, Huh!?
Van," Hey, wait! I'll pay that debt!"
Van, None of your business! This is what I got!
Van, Tsk! Just wait a little bit more! Then I'll be able to get the money you need!
Van," I'm going with these guys to search for the Frozen Flame! So, please! Wait just a little longer!"
Van," (Please, play along with me!!!) ~~~Help Van ~~~Never heard of it"
Van," Humph, how arrogant of her to push us around just because we're poor... If only we had money, if only we had money, this never would've happened..."
Van," I don't want to hear that from you, dad! Where are we going to live as of tomorrow!? We're out of money because we're not selling any of the paintings we have in this room!"
Van, Fine... Then I'm going to have to be the one to find us a place to live...
Van," Do you enjoy watching family disputes? There's absolutely, positively nothing here, so there's no point hanging around."
Van, Thanks... Thank you for going along with my bogus story...
Van," Hmm, I think it's a pretty good picture... So, why doesn't it sell? Dad isn't too active about selling his work. He says cocky things like he'll only sell to those who understand his work. Oh well... I guess I'll have to come up with the money myself."
Van," OK, let's see. My piggy bank is... Yup, it's here."
Van," OK, the money's in here, too. Now, the hardest part is finding a place to live."
Van, Next we have...
Van," Dad's homemade paint color, El Nido Blue."
Van," Painting the sea in this color gives it the smell of salt water...supposedly. If I were dad, I would've sold this paint by itself and made a fortune off it."
Van, This seashell...
Van, Mom... The only remaining reminder between me and mom is this shell.
Van," Tsk, it's cracked. I can't even hear the sound of the sea. But I... I remember it all... Mom found this shell and held it gently to my ear. And I remember that sound... that sound of the sea..."
Van," I also had a fit, because I couldn't take home the sand castle I made that day."
Van," And now, we have to move outta the house mom and I lived in... But don't worry, mom. I'll take good care of dad for you."
Van, You guys are still here? You need something? Or are you here to buy my dad's paintings?
Member, Actually what you were just saying...
Member, We really are looking for the Frozen Flame...
Van," Huh? If you're being sarcastic, you got me pretty ticked! Oh, I get it. Are you trying to cheer me up or something? Don't underestimate me because I'm a kid! I know that no such thing exists in this world. Or are you all some kind of simpletons?"
Member, Whether you believe it or not is up to you.
Van," ...Stop looking at me like that. You remind me of my mom. Your eyes tell me that you're telling the truth. Even I can see that. But I can't do it. I just can't leave my dad here and go off on some fool's errand, although it's tempting..."
Van, Dad...
Van, Just be careful to lock up at night... It'd be bad if any of the paintings were stolen...
Van," This is... a boomerang!? Dad, I'm not going out there to play! What am I going to do with this toy...?"
Van," ...... So it's a good luck charm, huh? Humph, I don't care for such things, but oh well. I'll take it with me, just in case."
Van, Alright... We gotta go before she comes back again!
System, Van joined your party!
Van," You need my help? I thought so. You guys probably couldn't even find a decent place to shop around here, right?"
System, Deposit some money? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Van,
Van, How much should I put it?
Van," Hmm, there's already"
Van, There isn't even 1G inside right now...
Van,
Van, Alright! It's full!!!
Zappa," Aye, that should do it. This here forge has always had a fire since aulden times. 'Tis sad to see it without its blaze."
Zappa, Mah apologies... Closing this shop for mah own selfish desires.
Zappa," Aye. Now that ah dinnae have the shop no more, likesay, it's time to finish what we started long ago. Ye stay here and wait for Karsh's return."
Zappa, Aye...
Zappa," Ah'm guessin' ye're no from around here. Do ye ken a thing called the 'rainbow'? It's a superb material that can be forged into anythin'. Ah'm thinkin' of searchin' for this rainbow. Ye wouldnae mind if ah joined ye, aye? ~~~Let him join ~~~Not now"
Zappa," Aye, great! Then ah'll give ye a wee token. Use this anytime, and ah'll find ye and do mah job, anywhere ye are. ...Ah give mah word!"
Zappa, Call me anytime ye like.
Zappa," Ah see... If ye change yir mind, give yours truly a call."
System, Zappa joined your party!
Zappa," No matter, the shop's already closed. Ye're free to call me when ye like."
Zappa," Ah'm sorry about what ah've done to ye, laddie. Ah couldnae finish teachin' ye the basics of smithing... But with yir passion, ye're sure to be a success at any job. Work hard as a trader, and make me proud."
Zappa, ......
Zappa, Radius...!? It's been a while... How fares the village?
Radius, You need not worry about the village... There are bigger things to concern us.
Radius," I believe it has been 4 years since I retired from the Dragoons... Sigh... Time sure does fly... I was shocked to hear of Dario's death 3 years ago... And now, the general and the others are missing... The manor is in shambles... I took the liberty of conducting my own investigation, but I have discovered nothing... All I know is that a man named Lynx approached the general and has involved him in some kind of incident. The only difference with the other world you talk about is that something has happened to the general 3 years ago..."
Radius, I just hope that this Norris fellow knows something...
Harle, I know not'ing. I waz not involved wit' ze plan.
Harle, I do not find it amuzing!
Norris," Sir Lynx! It has been a while, sir."
Norris," As you can see, the manor is in shambles. There is still no sign of the general or the others."
Norris," We are still investigating the area, but it appears that the Frozen Flame is not here."
Norris, Sir... Are you really Sir Lynx? You seem different than I last remember...
Radius, You are correct. This man is not Lynx.
Norris," Excuse me, sir, but who might you be?"
Radius," I am Radius, a dragoon. Although I have been retired for 4 years."
Norris," So you are Radius, one of the former 4 Devas!? It is an honor to meet you, sir!"
Norris," I believe you, sir, but... It is still hard to accept that this man is not Sir Lynx."
Radius," He may look like Lynx, but his spirit is of another."
Norris, That is... quite strange if I may say so.
Radius, It is up to you what you want to believe.
Radius," So, what business did you have with Lynx? Have you uncovered anything about the disappearance of the general? You will be doing us a great favor by telling us what you know."
Norris, Very well... I will tell you what I know.
Norris," It was actually Sir Lynx who approached us about the existence of the Frozen Flame in El Nido. Being from the main continent, we had doubted its very existence, so I was sent to El Nido Archipelago as a spy. I had narrowed down the location to Viper Manor, but it appeared as though General Viper and his men were in search of it as well. Eventually, I was called back to Porre, but it was then that I heard General Viper and his men had disappeared and that the manor had been destroyed as such. I heard only recently that there is good evidence the general and his men headed to the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is an ocean located to the east, surrounded by coral. It used to be called the Sea of Eden, but even then, not many dared enter. We investigated the area, but to no avail. We could find no entrance."
Norris," It is you, Sir Lynx, who wished to change this distorted world using the Frozen Flame."
Harle," Ooh la lah! Such grand dreamz, Monsieur Lynx!"
Radius, Hold your tongue.
Harle, Zut!
Radius, So... The Dead Sea...
Radius," That ocean was called the Sea of Eden until 3 years ago... This may just be the clue we were looking for. Once we uncover Lynx's plans, it should be easy enough to counter them."
Norris, Are you planning to go to the Dead Sea?
Norris," There is no way to get in there. We searched all over for an entrance, but to no avail. No one knows anything about it, either..."
Radius," Yes, I doubt you will be able to get in. I'm sure the demi-humans of Marbule know something about this, but they detest humans. Especially those from the main continent. Perhaps they would give us a hint if we were to go."
Norris," Then... May I join you, sir?"
Norris," I want to know. I want to know if the Frozen Flame really exists, and about everything that has happened here."
Radius, What about you?
Harle, Hm? Moi?
Harle, But of course! I will follow zis Monsieur Lynx!!! Ze oth4er one iz no longuer Monsieur Lynx.
Harle, Hmm? Moi?
Harle, But of course! I will follow this Monsieur Lynx!!! Ze odder one iz no longuer Monsieur Lynx.
Norris, There is a military boat docked in Termina. Let us use that.
System, Norris enlisted in your party.
Norris," How go the battle preparations? Do you have room for me, sir?"
Porre Soldier," That guy Norris sure is cocky. He's still young, but he doesn't hesitate to voice his opinion without any flattery. He never loosens up and doesn't seem interested in having any kind of fun. Now, he's the best of the Termina Division. Gosh, he's so elite. Hmm...? Ugh, Commander Norris!"
Norris," Thank you for your appraisal... Please eat and drink to your heart's content. Let us continue to fight together, from tomorrow on."
Porre Soldier, Yes sir!  Affirmative sir!
Member, A monster!? W-what's going on?
Member, The fairies of this isle have been...by them...? Heaven forbid!
Korcha," Huh? Who are you guys? Don'tCHA go walkin' into other people's homes without permission. Huh? Serge? I don't know anyone by that name. Never mind, if there's nothin' else then get outta here."
Macha," Oh, who mightCHA be? One of Korcha's friends? Strange, I don't recognize your faces. Hmm, I usually remember all of his friends who come around here, but... Oh well, no use wonderin' about such stuff. Cha-ha-ha!"
Macha," It's a small house, but feel right at home. My son's upstairs if you need him."
Doc, Medical science has its limits. I do not have the power to save her...dammit!
System, Would you like to rest? ~~~Yes ~~~No You hear voices outside... ~~~Check it out ~~~Go back to sleep
Member, ...... W-what's that...?
Member, What is that...?
Starky, Give me. Star Fragment!
Member," So, the real body of the monster was this small?"
Starky, Naha-naha... Naha-naha...
System, Catch him with the x button!!!
Member, Who are you?
Starky, But Starky's ship fall from sky.
Starky, Star Fragment is Starky's ship fragment. The ship turned to fragments after crash.
Member, So that's why you were collecting fragments.
Member," If we're lucky, your ship might still be intact in the other world."
Starky, Reeally! Whoopeee! Starky will come with you.
System, Starky jooined youur party!
Starky, Star Fragment is Starky's ship fragment.
Starky, The ship turned to fragments after crash.
Starky, Starky noo moore goo hoome.
Luccia, Vot is dis? The technology is amazing... It is definitely not of dis world.
Luccia," Actually... I have heard one of my colleagues talking about something very similar to dis. About a vehicle dat can travel through time. If dat is true, den dat means someone from the past or future may be here, in the present."
Member, What is this thing? How did it end up in here?
Member, This is one strange ship... Could it belong to that old man?
Starky," Woooooow! Amaazing! It still does not measure up to our technology, thoough."
Starky, Is this an antiprooton driive? A deevice that maakes tiime travel possible? It can't bee... EEven our technology hasn't advanced this far...
Fargo," It's been quite some time, Irenes... You've grown up..."
Fargo, What do you know...!? I lost everything when I lost Zelbess...
Fargo, You mean Nikki...?
Fargo, ......!? That child died with Zelbess when Luccia...
Fargo, I told you... The old me is dead...! Now what do you want!? I don't need to be lectured by you!
Fargo," I see... But why? You know that song, too, don't you?"
Fargo, Interesting... But so what? I don't want outsiders in Marbule... That suits me just fine.
Fargo," I'm not releasing the sage, no matter what you say."
Fargo, ......
Fargo," Hey, you're a new face! Relax and stay awhile. This ship belongs to me, myself, and I. I want everyone to enjoy themselves, courtesy of me! Stay as long as you like."
Old Man," Excuse me, but I need to get to work... Please let me through. ~~~Let him through ~~~Ask about the Marbule sage"
Member, We're looking for the sage of Marbule... Do you know anything?
Old Man," Hmmm... I don't believe he's here... Try elsewhere. Now please, I have to get to work."
Old Man, I have to mop the floors. Let me through.
Sneff," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Sneff's ffantastic magic show!!!"
Sneff, Is there anyone in the audience who would like to volunteer ffor this next trick?
Sneff," How about you, young lady?"
Sneff," Noffing to worry about, young lady... You're in good hands wiff Sneff. Now, please step up to the stage."
Sneff," Now, what is your name?"
Sneff," Well, let's start offf wiff someffing simple. Jill, you are going to walk on air! You're ffeeling lighter, Jill... Very...light..."
Sneff, One! Two! Free!
Sneff," And now, ffor the main event! Jill... You will now become a chair. You will be able to wiffstand any weight!"
Sneff, See... No strings!
Sneff, She's even able to support a ffatso like him!
Sneff," OK then, it's about time we brought Jill back!"
Sneff," So... How was it, Jill?"
Sneff, Fank you very much ffor your assistance.
Sneff, ......!? You don't believe in magic...? Looks like I have someffing to prove to you. Step up to the stage!
Sneff, You're a real live wire! What's your name?
Sneff," Well then, Jack... Seeing as how restless and irritated you are, here's one of my ffavorite tricks! I will turn you into a cat...! I call it... 'Cat on a Hot Tin Rooff!'"
Sneff," So, what do you fink?"
Sneff, Don't be affraid. I'll change you back to normal.
Sneff," Do you believe me now, Jack?"
Sneff, Fank you very much ffor your assistance. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. That's about it ffor today... Until next time!
Member, We'd like to get through to the Grand Slam...
Fargo," Oh? The Grand Slam, eh...? So you're out for blood... Tell me, where did you folks come from?"
Member, Marbule.
Fargo," What...? Marbule...? What are you doing here, anyway?"
Member, We're looking for the sage of Marbule.
Fargo," Well, well, well... I'm sorry, but there's no one of that sort aboard the Zelbess. Plus, I don't want strangers ruining my fun on my ship. Sorry... I can't grant you access."
Fargo," But that wouldn't be fun now, would it? The foundation of the Zelbess is entertainment. What do you say you try your luck?"
Member, Try out luck...?
Fargo," That's right. There's a casino down below. If you win, I'll give you access to the Grand Slam. But if you lose, how about you give me your boat docked by the entrance? Well, what do you say? ~~~Let's do it! ~~~No, thanks"
Fargo, Good. That's the spirit! I'll meet you down at the casino! Don't chicken out now... Hah hahahaha!
Fargo, Had enough? I'll take you on anytime!
Fargo," If you win, I'll give you access to the Grand Slam. If I win, I get your boat. Well...? ~~~Let's do it! ~~~No, thanks"
Sneff, Noooooo...! Not again...!!!
Fargo," Give it up, old man Sneff. You don't have what it takes. Just keep doing your shows, that's all."
Sneff," Nuff...!!! One of these days, I'm gonna slap your dirty fface wiff a wad of cash and get the hell offa this ship!"
Fargo," Well, well, well... Look who's here. That old man has built up quite a debt from this casino. So now, I own him. I suggest you don't let the same happen to you!"
Fargo," Excuse me, everyone... May I have your attention please... I need to have a private game with these folks. Would you mind leaving us alone for a while? I'll clear any debts you may have."
Man," Are you serious, Captain?"
Fargo, Did I stutter?
Man, Alright!
Man, The captain is G-O-O-D! Better watch it!
Man," Take it easy on 'em, Captain."
Fargo, Hah hahahahah!
Fargo, Thanks everyone. I'll be done soon.
Fargo," OK then, let's begin."
Fargo," Yes, 'Sudden Death.' The rules are simple. Press the x Button after the dealer spins the compass. We'll alternate turns. The pointer will stop on north, east, south or west. Should the pointer stop on south, where it stands now, you lose. Simple game, isn't it? Just don't make the pointer stop on south. It's a game of luck rather than skill."
Fargo, Heh heh... You're up.
Fargo, ...Luck of the devil... Here we go.
Fargo, Hah hahahah! You've got a ways to go before you can beat me!!!
Fargo," Well then, it looks like you owe me your boat. Don't hold a grudge. I won that game fair and square. I guess that means you'll have to swim back! Hah hahahaha!"
Member, Right above this inn is...
Member, The casino where we played Fargo...
Member," Something's fishy... If only we could move around freely, like that cat..."
Sneff," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Sneff's ffantastic magic show!!! You ffolks must be new around here... Would you like to volunteer? ~~~Sure ~~~No, thanks"
Sneff, Excellent! Please step up to the stage.
Sneff, Are you ready!?
Sneff," That's too bad. Then, ffor my card trick..."
Sneff, Nuff! Where do you think you're going!?
Sneff, Gotcha!!!
Sneff, Ooooh nooooo!!! I strained my back!!!
Sneff, SHUT UP!!! I still got it!!!
Sneff," I'm sorry, ffolks. Actually, there's absolutely no trick behind that magic. An old troll gave me a mysterious berry during my travels, long ago. She was saying someffing about the Bend of Time... Anyway, affter I ate the berry, I was able to transfform people into cats. I wish I could change you back to your human fform, but my achin' back... I'll need to lie down a bit, so you'll have to stay that way ffor a while. I hope you understand..."
Sneff, Nuuuuff...! Abracadabra... Zzzzzzz...
Fargo," Now why is that threesome looking for the sage...? I don't like the fact that they arrived here on a Porre boat, either... Who are they...?"
Fargo," Hello there, kitty..."
Fargo, She sure loved cats...
Fargo, Zelbess...
Fargo," You would look into the mirror and say... 'How I pity you, mirror, for man does not see you as the mirror that you are.' Did I see you as who you were back then? And is that my true self I see now? What would you think of me if you saw me today...? ...Aboard this ship, cheating people out of money..."
Fargo," Zelbess... Without you here, everything is meaningless..."
Nikki," The song of the demi-humans...? I've heard rumors about it, but does it really exist...? That song can save Marbule, right?"
Nikki, Wouldn't it make sense if the sage just sang the song?
Nikki, Will I be able to perform such an important song...?
Nikki," Fine. You seem to feel really strongly about this. Plus, I want to know more about the song..."
Nikki," You know... For some reason, the more I look at you, the more nostalgic I feel... Have we met somewhere before?"
Nikki," Are you without a family? Oh, then you're just like me."
Sneff, Noooooo! Why me!? This happens to me every time I start winning big!!!
Fargo," Hah hahaha!!! Too bad, old man! You have to learn when to quit!"
Sneff, Nuff...! I wanted to buy some cat ffood ffor those ffolks...
Fargo, Cat food...? For whom?
Sneff, Nuff...! None of your beeswax!
Sneff, O-O-Ouch...!!! M-My back...
System, Lynx received Handle!
Sneff, Ffinally... I'm able to stand up.
Sneff," I'm not 100% better yet, but... I fink I can change you back..."
Sneff," Uhhh... I have to start offf like that to concentrate. Anyway, here we go..."
Sneff," Ffew... That's a load offf my shoulders... I better stop using that magic. Listen, I'm very sorry you had to put up wiff being a cat. Iff there's anyffing I can do to make it up to you... I would like to help, but... Due to unfforeseen circumstances, I'm fforced to stay on this ship... Please do come by again iff you're ever around. The least I can do is offfer you a cup of tea..."
Sneff," Iff there's anyffing I can do to make it up to you... I would like to help, but... Due to unfforeseen circumstances, I'm fforced to stay on this ship... Please do come by again iff you're ever around. The least I can do is offfer you a cup of tea..."
Fargo, I can't allow you to go to the Grand Slam.
Nikki," But why? I really need to talk to the sage about teaching me the song...! Or else...that beautiful island, Marbule, will be gone forever! I can't just stand here and do nothing...!"
Fargo," You don't understand... True beauty is found within a dying entity. Therefore, I will watch over Marbule when its time comes... Furthermore, you and I have a contract. For the time being, you are in my possession. What am I supposed to do should anything happen to you? That would be a great financial loss for me..."
Nikki, So you're saying I'm nothing but a mere object...
Fargo," ...... If that is what you think, so be it."
Nikki, ~!!!~
Nikki, Th-That dressing table... It looks exactly like my mother's...!
Nikki, There's even that scratch I made when I was a child...! Wait a minute...!?
Nikki, Could it be that you are my... Father...!?
Fargo, ......
Nikki," The gentle and caring father I used to know!? You're my father, aren't you!? But why are you participating in such dubious acts!?"
Fargo," I am no longer the father you once knew... I lost everything when your mother, Zelbess passed away... Including myself... Laugh at me all you want. Pity me if you wish... But remember this, Nikki, man is not as strong as you think."
Nikki, ......Father... ...I......
Fargo," Do you folks want to challenge me again? You know you can't beat me. ~~~Let's do it! ~~~Forget it, then"
Fargo, Oh really!? You folks never learn... I'll meet you down there.
Fargo, Hehehe... That's smart.
Fargo, I thought you might have chickened out.
Fargo," OK then, I'll go first..."
Fargo, Hah hahahah! You should quit while you still can!
Fargo, You folks should probably cool off a little. Why don't you hit the bar or take a little rest? Come challenge me again later. I'll be waiting...! Hah hahahahah!
Fargo, WHAT...!? Impossible!
Fargo," ......!!! Interesting little item you got there... So I guess you found me out. I lose...heh heh... As promised, I'll give you access to the Grand Slam. Of course, you'll get your boat back as well."
Fargo, But how did you get a hold of that handle?
Fargo," You win. You wanted to go to the Grand Slam, right? Be my guest."
System,
System,
System, Whoo-hoo! Janice joined your party!
Old Man," Yes, what is it? Why are you following me? As you can see, I am quite busy. I do not have time for a game of tag. ~~~Where's the Dead Sea? ~~~It's nothing"
System,
Nikki, Finally...
Nikki," I knew I'd find you here... You know the legendary song of Marbule, right? I want you to teach me the song... Please...!"
Nikki, Irenes asked me...
Nikki," But it's not only because she asked me to. I personally have a great interest in that song. A beautiful song, originating from a beautiful island... I'm not 100% sure I'll be able to pull it off... But if it means I can save someone through my song..."
Nikki, ......! Who?
Nikki, ...My father!?
Nikki," Please... Don't speak badly of my father... No one understands the pain and suffering he's going through! Even though he has built up this lively place, he screams in sorrow alone, within his dark, deep self... But I can hear him! His screams of despair, which no one else can hear... or wants to hear..."
Nikki," I beg of you, please... I bet if my father hears that song..."
Nikki, But...!
Nikki, Then you'll...!?
Nikki, I saw the way you fought back there. I've been looking for tough guys like you. It would be an honor if we could talk inside my ship.
Fargo," Oh... So you folks found the sage, eh? Good for you. You got what you wanted. Now it's about time you left."
Man, What's goin' on!? What's up with old man Sneff today!?
Man," Ever since the captain lost, Sneff's been on a winning streak!"
Sneff," Hyah-hyah-hyah!!! Jackpots galore, baby!!! This is why I can't stop gambling! Lady luck is wiff me today, baby! Now I can pay offf my debt to the dirty captain!!!"
Sneff," Oh, it's you! Luck has ffinally come my way! I'm gonna pay offf my debt and get the hell offa this ship!"
Sneff, Why would I lie about someffing like that!? There's no reason ffor me to stay here now. I'm gettin' offa here.
Peppor, Th-This is kinda sad... It was 3 years ago when... you shook us in after you found us wandering around with amnesia...
Solt," We are greatly grateful to you...!!! We still have a ways to go with our stand up comedy act, but one day, we will really, truly make you laugh!"
Sneff," Lank and Stout... Iff I run into any of your comrades, I'll be sure to tell them you're doin' well."
Sneff," Good luck to you guys, too... And go on that diet, already."
Sneff," Come on, guys, Nuff mopin' around. This won't be the last time I see you. Take care, everyone."
Sneff, ...... Nah... Fforget it...
Sneff, ...Not until you're able to handle 4 swords... And not until someone laughs at Lank and Stout's jokes... I can't just leave my ffamily behind...
Sneff," But I just want you to know, I may be traveling wiff these people whenever they call upon me. Well then, who's up next?"
Peppor, W-We are!
Solt, Rightly right!!!
Sneff, And you two should be practicin' instead of crying!
Sneff, Well...? What are you going to do? ~~~Have him join your party ~~~Refuse him
System, Sneff joined your party!
Sneff, Call me anytime.
Sneff," They're still too green, I suppose... I guess they do need me!"
Sneff," Anytime, young lady!"
Fargo," Sneff... You're leaving, too...?"
Sneff, Hell yeah!!! I've paid offf my debt! But I'll be back to take care off unffinished business!
Fargo, It seems like everyone is moving on with their life... Except for me...
Sneff, What are you talkin' about? Just get your act together.
Fargo, ......
Nikki, Rockin'! I knew you'd come!
Nikki," Well, now that we're all here, here's my idea. How would you all like to save an island with a song?"
Nikki," No, I'm serious. According to Irenes, the island of Marbule is infested with monsters. Their only weakness is a demi-human song that the sage knows... While we perform our gig near the island, these people will exterminate all the monsters. That's the plan. Of course you'll help out, right? ~~~Of course! ~~~No, we can't"
Nikki, Rockin'! I knew you'd help.
Nikki," ......!? But you're my only hope! I have no one else to turn to! Besides, you owe the sage a favor, don't you? Please...!"
Nikki," Yes, I know. I don't intend to go with our ship alone. Wouldn't want to disappoint our fans aboard the Zelbess... The only hurdle left to clear now is how to convince my fath... I mean, Fargo. Inc17002I'll leave that up to you, Irenes. We have to concentrate on setting up the gig."
Nikki," So you're with me on this, Miki!? Great! Let's get ready for rehearsal, everyone!"
Nikki," Thank you for your support, Sage."
System, Irenes jöined yöur pärty!
Nikki, ......!? Another me...? I would love to have an opportunity to jam with you...!
Nikki, Rockin'! Likewise...!
Nikki, Marcy...
Marcy, What do you WANT from me!?
Nikki, ......
Sneff," This can't be...! Are you the rising star off the Magic Guild, Guile...!? What are you doing in a place like this!? Iff you're looking ffor work, I've got some great connections!"
Sneff, Nuff! Every magic has a trick! That's what makes it interesting!
System, There's a small mushroom growing.
Radius," Hmmm... I sense a strange vibe in the air... Stay alert, Serge. Let us proceed."
Radius," W-What is the evil sword, Masamune, doing here!?"
Radius, Ugh... It's no use... We will not be able to proceed without going mad.
Radius, Serge... We have no choice but to withdraw for now.
Radius, The path appears to be blocked off by that sword. He must already be in there... The negative sentiment associated with that sword has intensified. It will be impossible to proceed without going mad...
Norris," Is that the so-called evil sword, Masamune? Sir Radius, do you know anything about this sword?"
Radius, ......
Norris, What shall we do? We cannot make our way into the Dead Sea without removing that sword.
Member, There has to be a way! The Dead Sea is right under our nose!
Radius," Only the dragon sword, Einlanzer, can break the seal of the Masamune."
Norris, The Einlanzer? The sword forged by ancient Dragonians?
Member, The Einlanzer?
Radius," Yes... The legendary holy sword, forged by the Dragonites... I have placed that sword to rest beside its rightful owner, Garai. May he rest in peace within that cavern... Although it pains me to disturb his eternal sleep, we have no other choice..."
Member, Where is this cavern...?
Radius," We know it today as the 'Isle of the Damned.' It used to be an ordinary cavern until it mutated into a nesting ground for demons... I believe this may be the result of Garai's sentiments which lingered. A negative sentiment, which the holy sword could not even restrain. In order to make our way in there, we need a certain item that Garai used while he was still alive. I have stored it away in a hut where Garai and I used to train. We must go and get this item..."
Radius, We must do something about that sword in order to proceed. Let us withdraw for now.
Radius, We need the power of the Einlanzer to destroy that sword. We must withdraw for now. Let us stop by my hut. There is something I'd like to pick up before heading to the Isle of the Damned.
Radius, We need the power of the Einlanzer to destroy that sword. We must withdraw for now.
Radius, It took you long enough. I've been waiting forever.
Radius," ...... Dario's father, Garai, and I used to frequent this island for our training..."
Radius, Sigh... I lose again...
Radius," Hah! You're about the only one who knows that, since we practice together so often."
Radius," Yeah, right..."
Radius, The Einlanzer is a legendary holy sword passed onto the most skilled swordsman of the Acacia Dragoons. It belonged to Garai before Dario took over the title. He was a magnificent dragoon...
Radius, Could this really be it? The sword of legend... the Masamune!!!
Radius, My word...
Radius, What could be wrong? This is a legendary sword!!!
Radius," See, Garai..."
Radius, There's nothing to fear!
Radius, Aahhh...
Radius, The Masamune... That sword is cursed with hate and sorrow... Anyone who lays his hands on it will be overcome with negative sentiments and will be driven mad... I......
Radius, ...... Enough talk from an old man... Just wait here a moment.
Radius," Sorry to keep you waiting. With this mirror, we should be able to make it to the inner parts of the Isle of the Damned."
System, Radius put away Garai's Keepsake.
Radius, Let us be off to the 'Isle of the Damned.'
Radius, No... Garai...! Nary a day passes when I haven't looked back on that day...
Radius, I was overcome by the power of that sword!
Radius, I know...
Radius," Hey, Garai..."
Radius, HAHAHAHAHAA! Now I'm the top swordsman of the Acacia Dragoons!
Radius," Hah, I did it! I'm the greatest! HAHAHAHAAH..."
Radius, Huh? What happened?
Radius, Oh Lord...? What have I done?
Radius, NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Radius," I know I lost my sanity because of that sword... But I must admit, the sword is not entirely to blame. I was jealous of Garai... I wanted to be the better swordsman. The once renowned Masamune... 'The Holy Sword That Conquered Darkness.' Could it be merely a tool for murder...?"
Radius, Garai!? No...!
Radius," Listen to me, Garai! We need the Einlanzer to seal the cursed evil sword!"
Radius, In order to  believe in what is right... must one suffer pain and sorrow?
System,
Radius," I have always been prepared to fall to a sword held by one of your sons... Perhaps Glenn will take on that role, now that Dario is gone."
Radius," However, I must attend to some unfinished business. Please wait a little longer. Garai... Forgive me, my friend..."
Radius," Come, Serge. The Einlanzer shall lead the way!"
Radius," Oh, Garai... We shall use the holy powers of the Einlanzer..."
Radius," The sword is a reflection of one's soul. How I pity you... You've done no wrong, either."
Radius," I just hope that, one day, that sword will be freed of enmity..."
Radius, The Dead Sea... I cannot imagine what kind of spectacle lies ahead...
Radius," Where do you think you're going, Serge? The Dead Sea is right before our eyes!"
Member, This is... the Dead Sea... This is some sight... I feel like I am living a nightmare...
Member, The waves are at a standstill... And... What is that dark shadow in the distance...?
Member," The treacherous ocean... The earth, condemned by Dragon Gods... It's not all that bad..."
Norris," What is it, sir?"
Norris," So many strange things happening here... The power source is still active. I do have knowledge of electrical engineering. Can you give me a minute, sir?"
Norris, Let's see...
Norris," ......There... The monitor should be able to display some information, sir."
Member, Norris? Can't you download more info about this world?
Norris," Ahhh... Yes! One moment, please."
Member," What happened, Norris!!? What happened to the screen!?"
Norris," The power supply has gone out. At this rate, we will not be able to gather further information. Damn... We were so close to learning more about 'Lavos'..."
Norris, We will not be able to find out anything new... Let's proceed.
System, No power...
Norris, This must be the center of the Dead Sea... All this chaos must have spread out from here.
Member, This must be the center of the Dead Sea... All this chaos must've spread out from here.
Radius, The buildings seem to have melted into one giant conglomeration. What happened to this place?
Member, The buildings seem to have melted into one giant conglomeration. What's up with this place?
System, It's too slippery to make your way through the duct.
System, There's something on the ground.
System,
Member," What's wrong, Serge? Did you see something?"
Member, Are you alright?
Member, What? You saw a child? I didn't see a child anywhere...
Member, ~!?~
Member, Nothing will surprise me here. ...Let's just keep going.
System,
Member," We're inside a building, yet what's this thing doing in here...?"
Member, This place is beyond me...
Zappa," Arrchh! What's goin' on here!? Karsh...!? Is that you, lad...!? Ah don't believe this...!"
Radius, What in heaven's name is going on here...!? General...! Miss Riddel!!! And Glenn and the other dragoons...! What could have happened here...!?
Norris, Th-These are the Acacia Dragoons who disappeared 3 years ago... W-What went on here...?
Harle," It iz unfortunate, but it appearz zey were held captive here before zey died... It'z too late... Zey are so close, yet so far. No one can help zem..."
Member, What's going on!? What does this all mean...!?
Member, Are you alright? What's wrong?
Member," You've been acting strangely ever since we entered the building. Is it that child again? Ther'es no turning back now! We must keep going, Serge."
Member, ...A sunset!? Have the clouds from the Dead Sea cleared up?
Member, It appears that the dimension itself is more unstable here than elsewhere. It's a time and space within a structure completely different from anywhere else.
Member," Luckily, the distortion to leave this place is still here. That's good news for us."
Member, Who are those children...?
Member, It's Serge's fault that the world will end up like this...?
Man, Welcome to the Tower of Geddon... Time Crash Ground Zero!
Man," It's been a while, Serge. ...But...I guess you don't remember who I am. I don't blame you. You were only a little child back then."
Man," I'm Miguel. A friend of your father. According to the time outside, it's been about 14 years since the night of the storm..."
Member, How is that possible...!?
Member, How can this be!?
Harle, ......
Member, Serge!? You can't be serious!?
Member, We can't just let ourselves die here!
Member, We're not going to make it!
Member, Why did you help us?
Member," Serge, you're concerned about the other world, aren't you?"
Member, The dimensional distortion should be back in order. Let's head to Opassa Beach.
Member, Could this light be a wormhole?
Member, But the amulet isn't responding.
Member, So this is the dimensional gate...
Member, Then let's get going!
Harle, You are a nuisance! Are you planning to stand in Monsieur Lynx's way?
Zappa, Ye're a pain in me arse. Scram!
Van, Leave now! If you want to live.
Norris," Begone, demons, if you value your lives."
Sneff," Now's your chance to run, ffools!"
Starky, Leeave now. Wee do not want to fiight in vaain.
Member," Begone, if you wish to live."
Harle, Get out of our way.
Member, We'll take you on.
Member, It looks like there's much chaos going on here.
Harle," An uprizing led by Serge!? So, Serge has become ze enemy of ze people..."
Starky, A reevoolt led by Serge? Why do peeople kill one another?
Member, A revolt led by Serge...? Is Serge siding against the people?
Nikki," Serge....!!! You made it out alive..? I almost had to sing a requiem for myself, before I realized I somehow made it out alive... I still see and hear images from that place in my dreams all the time... Sorry man, I don't want to go out for a while."
Nikki, Who are you?
Glenn," You are...!? But that body of yours is not going to return to normal... I am sorry, but please leave. I do not want to see that face of yours for now."
Van, The soldiers are all dawdling around here... I do wonder what is happening?
Van," My goodness... You look like me...! Could you be a doppelgänger? If so, am I going to die and go to heaven soon?"
Van, What are you talkin' about?
Van," So you are not? Hahaa, then you must be father's illegitimate son... Normally, this would be a tearful reunion or some such thing, but I am not a dullard."
Van," ...... I know this guy's me, but it hurts my head knowin' he's such a blockhead."
Van, How dare you! What do you mean 'BLOCKHEAD!?'
Van," Oh well, keep workin' on your paintings. I'll take care of all the dirty work."
Van," I do not comprehend what you are saying, but best of luck to you, too."
Van," ...... I guess there's problems in any world you go to. Hey, me! Let's both try to live up to our best!"
Zappa," A craftsman's workshop is a dangerous place for a layman. It's yir own damn fault for coming near it. Besides, by what need do ah have to listen yir order? Ah'll take no orders from ye. Begone with ye, for ah've work to finish."
Porre Soldier, So you are not going to stop work no matter what?
Zappa," Don't make me tell ye the same thing twice. Ah've got a short temper. If ye ken what ah said, then get yirself out."
Zappa," Ah dinnae care who tells me, ah'm no gonna stop workin'..."
Zappa," Am ah over-working meself? Ah'm staindin' in front of mah own eyes... Nay, ah must be losing mah concentration. Focus, Zappa, focus!"
Zappa," Whoa, is no that the Rainbow!? When ah was a lad, ah traveled with me wife searchin' for it but... So, it really exists. Ah would love to get mah hands on it... but from what ah can tell, this thing can't be forged by meself. Now, if we had another skilled blacksmith like yours truly, that would be a different story. Rather unlikely story, though. Hahaha!!!"
Zappa, Ye be me...!?
Zappa, Ah need yir help. Ah want to hammer this thing to make that ye-know-what...
Zappa," That thing ye have... It's the Rainbow! So this ye-know-what ye be talkin' about is the Rainbow Axe, then?"
Zappa," Ah knew ah could count on meself... So, shall we start hammerin'? It be a wee bit hard by meself, but two of us working together should be a breeze."
Zappa, Hmm... Ah would love to help ye... But this here hammer's too weak for the job. If ah had a sturdier hammer... Looks like ah'm no use to ye for the time being. My apologies.
Zappa, Ay... Ye might be right.
Pierre," That Serge, who had the privilege of meeting moi, was a villain after all... It is just as moi thought... you can never trust those silent types...!"
Zoah, WE MEET AGAIN...
Karsh," It's been a while, Lynx... Or is it Serge?"
Karsh," ...? That Porre scumbag's with you!? Humph, well as long as you're here, you're one of us. You! Stay put and listen to what we gotta say!"
Karsh," After we fought you guys, we also entered Fort Dragonia too..."
Karsh, General!!!
Karsh, !!! You're...!?
Karsh, He disappeared!? ......! Damn!
Karsh, This is bad... General! Are you alright!?
Viper, U-Ughhh... Riddel...
Karsh, ......
Karsh, Don't just stand around! Help the general!!!
Zoah, I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO THE GENERAL...
Marcy, Like...I can't believe it...
Zoah, WHAT IN DRAGOON'S NAME HAPPENED HERE...?
Marcy," So, like, what are all these shiny shards...?"
Karsh," Not now! We have to stop the bleeding! Marcy, you pick up those broken pieces!"
Karsh," We brought the general to Hermit's Hideaway and prayed for his recovery. He was able to escape death, but he still needs rest. However, we can't leave the manor for too long... So we came back here, leaving Marcy behind to take care of him, only to find..."
Zoah, THE PORRE MILITARY HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF TERMINA...
Karsh, DAMMIT! What a shame!!!
Karsh, Because of them Porres!!! Whaddaya got to say to that!?
Norris," ...... I, too, question the methods the military has taken. That is why I am acting in line with Sir Lynx..."
Karsh, Hmph!!! Then don't ya dare get in my way!
Zoah,
Karsh," That bastard. He's not gonna get away with this! We've got some fault in all of this, so we gotta do something about it."
Karsh," But first, we've gotta rescue Lady Riddel. She's being held captive at the manor, which the Porre military has converted into their headquarters... Hey, with your uniform, you can enter undetected, right? Let's join forces for the time being! It's not too late to go after him!"
Zoah, ONE OF US WILL REMAIN HERE TO COLLECT INFO. THE OTHER WILL ENTER THE MANOR. LET US MEET AFTERWARDS.
Karsh," Oh yeah. The shards on the ground must've been the Dragon Tear... We've gathered as many as possible, but we don't have any use for it. You can have them."
System,
Zoah, WE HAVE GOT TO HURRY. NOT MUCH TIME.
Zoah, WATCH OUT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE PORRE MILITARY WILL PULL OFF.
Karsh, We don't have much time. Let's get a move on it!
Karsh, We're counting on ya!
Zappa," Karsh...!? Ye be alive, lad! Thank the heavens... Go show yer face to mother as well. She's been awaiting yir return."
Karsh," I don't know what's going on, but once this is settled, I'll do that."
Zappa," Aye, dinnae forget!"
Karsh, Whaaat? Why the hell didja do that for!
Karsh, Ugh!!!
Karsh," Holy smokes, a fruitcake like you in MY room!? Arrgh, this makes me sick!"
Pierre," This man is rather vulgaire... As a Deva, you must show more grace and refinement!"
Karsh," Arrgh, this guy's useless!"
Norris," Then bring this boy Serge to me, as soon as you find him."
Porre Soldier," Yes, sir!"
Norris," Why, Sir Lynx!!!"
Norris," Sir Lynx, where have you been all this time? We heard that you headed to Fort Dragonia with the general. Exactly what happened back there? There have been many strange occurrences since then. Perhaps you know of a boy named Serge?"
Norris," ......!!! The man behind you is Acacia Dragoon Deva Karsh!!! Sir Lynx, you were in the middle of taking him into custody, sir?"
Norris," ......!!! The man behind you is Acacia Dragoon Deva Zoah!!! Sir Lynx, you were in the middle of taking him into custody, sir? ...!!!"
Norris, You are... me!? Wh-What is going on...?
Norris," Let's just say I am another you and leave it at that. Pardon me for saying this, but it appears that both of us need to look at the big picture. We will only have a limited understanding by staying in the same place."
Norris, S-Silence!
Porre Soldier," Commander Norris, there is an urgent message from command!"
Norris, What is it?
Porre Soldier," Umm, sir, it is a level 2 security message..."
Norris," Go ahead, take no heed. This man is one of us."
Porre Soldier," Yes, sir! Grobyc has just arrived at the manor, sir."
Norris," Hmm... He is quite ahead of schedule. Understood, I will return ASAP."
Porre Soldier," Yes, sir!"
Norris," Sir Lynx, forgive me, but I must return to the manor at once. Please come to the manor a little later. We will discuss this in more detail there."
Porre Soldier," Sir Lynx, please go on through. Please go on through."
Riddel," I do not know. And even if I did, I would never tell you!"
Norris," Please, sir, this woman has done nothing wrong."
Norris," I do not believe that, sir. There has to be a better way to go about this! Just give it a little more time and..."
Norris," No, please! Wait!"
Norris, ......
Porre Soldier," Yes, sir!"
Norris," Please, wait. Think of what you are doing. Can you live with that?"
Norris, This cannot be... Is he the one from the lab...?
Porre Soldier," Yes, sir!"
Norris, Sir Lynx! Please excuse these squalid conditions.
Norris, ......!!!
Norris, Who are you? Another me!? W-What is going on...?
Norris," Let's just say I am another you and leave it at that. Pardon me for saying this, but it appears that both of us need to look at the big picture. We will only have a limited understanding by staying in the same place."
Norris, S-Silence!
Norris, I am sorry... There is nothing I can do about it.
Norris, Sir... This has been bothering me since we met up in Termina. You seem different from what I last remember... You just seem... different...
Member, This man's not Lynx.
Norris, What?
Member," He may look like Lynx on the outside, but his spirit is that of Serge."
Norris, Is it true? Sir Lynx... What has happened?
Norris, I see...
Norris, So the Serge commanding the insurgent troops is the real Lynx... Everything is starting to make sense.
Norris, We were wrong all along. We never should have joined forces with Lynx...
Norris, And what brings you here?
Karsh," Riddel!!! Where is Lady Riddel!!!? Bring her out, NOW!!! You lay one filthy finger on her and you die! ARGHHHHHH!"
Member, General Viper's daughter should be here.
Norris, I see... Then you are here to rescue her.
Norris," Understood. I would like to help. Riddel should be in the basement prison. Please, take this."
System, Member received the Prison Key!
Norris, There is a sewage system below the prison. You should be able to break into the prison by making your way through the sewers. Use the hatch downstairs.
Norris," The sewers are full of monsters. Please be alert, I have heard of one particularly frightful monster."
Norris, I will be in the 1F main hall. Please meet me there once you rescue Riddel.
Norris, You can access the sewage system from a hatch downstairs.
Norris, Let us meet up at the 1F main hall after you rescue Riddel.
Porre Soldier," Hi, Orcha. It's that time again!"
Porre Soldier, You know... This...
Porre Soldier, Your guest is waiting in the basement.
Luccia, Vot is it you vant?
Luccia, You are really Lynx? There is somet'ing different about you.
Luccia, Dä?
Member, The water's flow is too fast... We should be able to stop it somewhere.
Fargo, Arg...! What the hell am I doin' here...?
Fargo, I miss the smell o' the sea...
Fargo, ARG!!!
Fargo, Somethin' down below!?
Member, Is anybody there?
Fargo, Aye! Hold on a bit.
Fargo, Heave...
Fargo, HOOOOOO!!!
Fargo, Shiver me timbers! LYNX!?
Member, Just calm down... Do you really think Lynx would be here?
Fargo," He's right before me eyes, ain't he!?"
Member, This isn't Lynx. He's Serge on the inside.
Fargo, You're pullin' me leg!
Fargo, Hmmm... It is strange that he'd be here...
Fargo, But I'm honored that you would come save me. I owe ya one.
Member, We're not here to rescue you. We're here to rescue General Viper's daughter.
Fargo," Oh, is that so. Well, you ended up savin' me anyway. Let me help."
Member, Do you know where General Viper's daughter is?
Fargo, Aye...! A young lass was taken to the cell next door.
Fargo," Well, how do we get outta here?"
Member, Here's the key to the prison.
Fargo," Oh, great."
Fargo, I'm gonna go free the others and make me escape. Good luck to ya.
Riddel," You are the cook, Orcha!"
Riddel, What have you done to him!?
Riddel," How horrible... But why, Orcha...?"
Riddel, NO!
Karsh, Lady Riddel!!! I have come to save you!
Karsh," Actually, this man ain't Lynx!"
Member," Actually, this man isn't Lynx!"
Member, It's too hard to explain. We're just here to take Riddel back.
Porre Soldier, The fun's just about to start.
Porre Soldier, Please continue cooking.
Riddel, Stop Orcha!
Member," I told you, he's not Lynx!"
System, Orcha joinedCHA party.
Norris, I will take it upon myself to make sure Riddel leaves the premises safely.
Norris, Please distract the soldiers while we make our escape.
Riddel, I would like to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I shall be heading to Hermit's Hideaway to take care of my father. Please be sure to stop by when you get the chance.
Karsh, Don't worry 'bout us. I'll make sure to wipe out all these Porre buffoons!
Riddel, Thank you... Karsh.
Member, What do you plan to do after all this?
Norris, I will be returning here.
Member, Then why don't you join us?
Norris," Thank you, I am honored. However, as a soldier of the Porre military, I cannot abandon my country or my men."
Norris, I will be fine. Thank you.
Norris, I wish you the best of luck.
Norris," When you get a chance, please come by and see me again, Norris... There is something I wish to give you. Good luck."
Norris, So you are the Norris from the other world. Please come by and see me when things settle down. There is something I wish to give you. Good luck.
Norris, We must hurry.
Riddel, Good-bye...
Member, We're completely surrounded...!
Member, It's not a good idea to leave now.
Member, I guess we can't talk our way out of this one...
Porre Soldier, Follow the commander's orders.
Porre Soldier, You can't escape!
Member, I thought we already destroyed it?
Member, It must be a new type...
Member, It's right behind us!
Member, No! We're trapped!
Member, What do we do!?
Member, We don't have time!
Member, It won't be able to make it up here.
Member, ~!!!~
Member, Don't be foolish...!
Member, Unbelievable...
Member, This is endless!
Porre Soldier, Over here!
Porre Soldier, Huh? What was that noise?
Member, This is great!
Member, You're...!?
Member, Why did you save us?
System, Grobyc-joined-your-party.
Member, Let's escape while we still can.
Member, There should be a boat ready. Let's head to Hermit's Hideaway.
Norris, ......!!!
Norris, Who are you? Another me!? W-What is going on...?
Norris," Let's just say I am another you and leave it at that. Pardon me for saying this, but it appears that both of us need to look at the big picture. We will only have a limited understanding by staying in the same place."
Norris, S-Silence!
Norris, I am sorry... There is nothing I can do about it. You are a Norris from another world.
Norris," Please bring the Norris from your world, here. There is something I wish to give him."
Norris," Please take this, Norris... I no longer need it."
System, Received Norris's TopShot!
Norris, We have decided to withdraw from here. We shall be returning to the mainland in due time.
Norris, I must be off.
Luccia," You are not Lynx, but Serge, correct? I am sorry, but I do not know vot you must do to regain your true form."
Luccia, If the Dragon's Tear has anyt'ing to do vith it... You may be able to find something out in Guldove.
System," It says, 'Respect my behind.' There's a letter inside."
Karsh, Damn! What are those idiots up to!?
Radius, Halt.
Karsh," Hey, gramps..."
Marcy," No, Radius. He's not Sir... I mean he's not Lynx."
Radius, So you mean to tell me that you are really Serge...?
Radius," Hmmm... This is hard to take in so suddenly, but I do not sense Lynx's evil within you..."
Radius, Hmmm... So this is the me from the other world.
Radius," I expected nothing but the best. You have brilliant skills, just like me..."
Radius," Hmph, that's my line. You have brilliant skills like mine to have been able to block like that."
Radius, Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!!!
Radius, Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!!!
Zoah, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THEY WILL FIND YOU IF YOU LEAVE NOW.
Karsh, Where do you think you're going? They'll find us for sure if we leave now.
Zoah, I AM NOT USED TO BEING PURSUED...
Radius," I heard what happened. I just couldn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes. Oh, and thank you for saving Miss Riddel. I am very grateful."
Radius," General Viper's wound is healing nicely, thanks to Marcy nursing him back to health. The general should be up and about by tomorrow."
Karsh," Rrrrargh!!! Those Porre jokers piss me off!!! At least we were able to save Lady Riddel. But still, one of these days, I'll kick every one of them out of our manor!"
Riddel," Thank you kindly for everything, Serge. I have heard much of what has happened. We cannot allow Lynx to carry on like this. I owe you a debt of gratitude, so I would like to fight alongside you. I may be inexperienced in battle, but I hope you will find me helpful."
System, Riddel joined your party!
Riddel, You seem very tired. I do recommend that you rest.
Riddel, Would you like to rest? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Marcy, Serge... right? Ummm... Like... I'm sorry... for everything...
Harle," Hah hah! You're too cute to be ze killer doll, Marcy."
Marcy," W-WHAT!? Are you tryin' to pick a fight with me, Harle!?"
Harle, I'm sure defeating zis Marcy will be a cinch.
Marcy, Y-Y-YOU...!!!
Harle," Let'z fight, non?"
Member, That's enough. We have a patient here.
Harle, D'accord... OK...
Marcy," NahÌ, nahÌ, na-na-nahÎ!"
Harle, Bluuuugh!
Karsh, What the...!?
Viper, They have come.
Riddel," You look much better, daddy."
Viper, Sorry to worry you.
Viper," All thanks to Marcy. Sorry to trouble you like this, Marcy..."
Viper, Looks like I worried everyone as well...
Karsh," Aaah, DAMN!!!"
Kid," Show your face, Lynx! Yer 9 lives are up!!!"
Karsh, ......!? I recognize that voice.
Zoah, INDEED.
Marcy, Kid...
Harle, Kid...
Member," Wait, Serge!"
Kid," Oi, Lynx!!! Today's the day I finish you off!"
Member, Are you alright!? She's quite serious. And...I have a bad feeling about this... She doesn't seem to be herself...
Serge," Heh heh heh... Yes...she is indeed Kid. However, right now, you are the one who is Lynx. And I am Serge. Once our roles were reversed, so were our problems. To her, killing you will avenge Lucca."
Serge," Right, Kid?"
Kid," Yeah, I'll put an end to Lynx today... and avenge Lucca!!!"
Member, I think we'd better retreat for now.
Serge, Give it up. We have this shack completely surrounded. There's no way you can escape.
Member, ......!!!
Fargo, We'll see about that!
Fargo, Serge!!! Hop on!
Serge, Damn! They got away. Heh... Anyway... this is only the beginning... of everything...
Fargo," Good work, Polly."
Fargo," Good, good..."
Kid," Hey, Serge...! How about you and me team up for a while? For cryin' out loud... Would ya just shut up and get on with it...! I'm gonna kick yer sorry arses so hard you'll kiss the moons!"
Kid," Just you wait, Lynx! Today's gonna be the day of reckonin'!!! Say yer prayers! ...Not that it'll do ya any good!!!"
Kid, I've had it up ta here with you!!!
Kid," Yeah... I know. This is the end of you, Lynx!!! Say yer prayers!"
Harle, Serge...
Harle," Tell me... What iz ze most important t'ing in your life...? Ask yourself what you can do, and what you need to do, in order to attain it."
Harle," If not you, zen whom!? If not now, zen when!? Right? ...Serge?"
Fargo, Viper!!! Let's settle this old score once and for all!!! Prepare yerself!!!
Viper," ...... Is that you, Serge.? Fargo, our duel will have to wait. I need to have a talk with Serge.."
Fargo, Tch... Have it yer way...
Viper," Serge, Lynx has headed to the Sea of Eden. We must do everything in our power to prevent him from obtaining the Frozen Flame. I shall lend a hand. We must put a stop to him."
System, General Viper joined your party!
Fargo, Arg... What the hell...
Fargo," Aye, Serge! I'll help ya out, too. Ya saved me life twice already. And, I guess I already know too much. I can't just sit around and ignore the situation."
System, Fargo joined yer party!
Fargo," Viper! I'll deal with ya later. Once we put an end to this situation, you're mine!"
Viper, Very well. I will not run from you. I will be happy to accept your challenge.
Marcy, Waaaaaait!
Marcy," We're comin', too. I hope that's okay with you, Serge?"
System," Marcy, like, joined your party!"
Zoah," I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO HELP. THERE IS NO POINT IN MY NOT FIGHTING. PLUS, YOU SAVED MISS RIDDEL. ACCEPT THIS GESTURE AS A TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION."
System, ZOAH JOINED YOUR PARTY!
Karsh," Hah! There ain't no way I'm backin' outta this. And since you saved Lady Riddel, I've decided to help you out. Please, just a thank you will be enough!"
System, Karsh joined your party!
Viper," Shall we be on our way, Serge?"
Member, A dead end?
Member, Can't we go any further?
Member, Do you know how to get through here?
Harle, You wish to know?
Harle," Zis place iz called ze Pearly Gates. Zis used to be ze only entrance to ze Sea of Eden. However, legend sayz, no one haz been able to see it or approach it, ever since ze Dragonz sealed ze evil flame."
Member, Then how are we supposed to get in?
Harle, You need ze powerz of ze Dragonz zat sealed ze flame. You must break ze seal of ze Pearly Gates with2 relics from each of ze 6 Dragonz.
Member, Relics? Break the seal? You mean here?
Harle," Non. Ze true gate to ze Sea of Eden iz not here. It iz in ze other world, Where ze Dead Sea liez."
Member," So, where are we supposed to find the 6 Dragons?"
Harle," You will find zem scattered around both worldz. Zey will be eazy to find, with2 all ze legendz about dragonz throughout ze islandz."
Harle," Oh, and Monsieur Lynx... Ze other Monsieur Lynx, disguized az Serge, iz already in here. Zat iz because hiz appearance iz zat of Serge."
Member, What do you mean?
Harle," Even if you are able to get all 6 Dragon Relics, you will not be able to make it inside az Monsieur Lynx."
Member, Then what are we supposed to do?
Harle," Ze Dragon Tear... Zat iz all I can tell you. Now, it'z my turn to ask un question."
Harle, Monsieur Lynx...
Harle, If you had to chooze between ze world or moi... which would you chooze? ~~~Harle ~~~The world ~~~I don't know
Harle, Oooh... Merci... Even if it iz a lie.
Harle," Tsk, tsk, tsk!"
Harle, That iz exactly what I t'ought Monsieur Lynx would say.
Fargo," You go, sea-dog! Go and find yerself!"
Riddel, I wish you well.
Harle," Why must I have to tell him such t'ings...? You are such an idiote, Harle..."
Starky," What's wrong, Harle? There is fluid coming out of youur eyes."
Harle," ......!? Oh, it'z you, Starky. It'z not'ing. Don't worry about it."
Starky, Something is different. Starky can tell. Harle's maake-up doesn't look the saame todaay.
Starky," Starky don't think it's nothing liike youu saay. Why do youu liie to mee, Harle?"
Harle," D'accord... OK, OK... I guess I cannot fool you."
Harle," Listen, Starky... Zis iz called a tear. It'z somet'ing zat flowz from your eyez naturellement when you are sad, when you hurt..."
Starky, Teear...? To cry...? Soo water comes out from eyes when youu are sad? Are youu sad soo youu can wash youur faace with teear?
Harle," Sigh... Go to sleep, Starky. And don't tell anyone I waz crying. You promise you will not tell?"
Starky, Starky liike promises. Starky will promise not to tell aanyone that Harle was cryiing.
Starky, Waait a minute... Cryiing meeans that Harle is sad. But why?
Harle," Even though we are close, I cannot tell you zat."
Harle," You will find out eventually, Starky. If zat time comez..."
Harle, Every problème haz a solution... I hope...
Karsh, Man... I feel relieved... Actually... No...! Forget it!
Riddel, I can hear Karsh yelling at times... I do wonder what is troubling him...?
Marcy," Hey, Serge.. C'mon, take me with you. I wanna beat up Lynx real bad!"
Member, What is it?
Member, If we're able to cross dimensions here... We should be able to make it into the Sea of Eden.
Member, Is this a wormhole?
Member, This must be what Harle was talking about.
Member, What should we do now? At this rate we won't be able to borrow the Dragon Tear.
Member, Speaking of the Dragon Tear... Shouldn't we return the broken tear to the shrine in the other world? The shaman in the other world might be able to help us somehow.
Old Man," M-M-Master Viper!? Oh, my goodness... Could this be a dream?"
Viper," This is no dream... I always knew, that you have been polishing my statue all these years... I must express my deepest gratitude to you. I give you my promise to bring Termina back into our hands once again."
Old Man," Oh, precious words for such an unworthy old soul...!"
System, It won't open! There must be a way... Received Zoah's Toss&Spike!
Viper," A trap...! If I recall, there is a note with instructions on how to bypass this trap. It should be in the drawer inside my room."
System, There's a switch. ~~~Push it ~~~Leave it alone
Marcy," I swear, I'm gonna teach that Lynx a lesson! After I'm done with him, he'll be beggin' for 9 more lives!"
Riddel," Where might we be drifting to, now?"
Viper," First, we must track down Lynx. We do not have time to spare, Serge.. Let us head to the Sea of Eden."
Karsh," Tch...! I'm gettin' restless here! C'mon, Serge., take me with you!"
Karsh, Man... This guy sleeps like a log!
Zoah, ZZZZ... ZZZZ...
Zoah, BUZZZZ... ZZZZZZ...
Zoah, UGHAHA... ZZZZ... MMMM...
Zoah, THAT WAS YUMMY...
System, Pip joined your party again!
Member, Doens't that seem odd to you?
Member, Are they quarrelling among themselves? It's pretty one-sided.
Member, What should we do? ~~~Help out ~~~Forget it...
Member, Stop! Aren't you comrades?
System,
Member, Have we brought about any change by defeating that Hydra...? Did we do the right thing?
Member," Who knows what is right or wrong? Nobody has the answer. ...Serge, we should get going."
System,
Member," Serge, isn't there something strange about this village?"
Member, Hmm? What's going on? People are gathering over there. Let's go find out what's up.
Member, Porre soldiers!? In a small village like this!?
Member, But something's odd. And who's that lady?
Porre Soldier," Wh-Why me, sir?"
Porre Soldier, Y-You heard us. C-Cease your r-resistance. A woman should...be more gentle a-and lady-like...
Member, Wait! I order you and your troops to return to headquarters. We will take care of this girl. This village will be under Sir Lynx's command until further notice. Report that back to high command.
Member," Didn't you hear? This is an order from your superior officer. If you disobey, you will be court-martialed. Do I make myself clear?"
Doc, I cannot believe it... Is it possible that such a thing can occur...?
Doc," Hey, even you should not get up so soon. ...Are you alright? Even though you are a trained fighter, you should refrain from pushing yourself too hard."
Member, Serge received the SapphireBrooch.
Doc, Orlha!? Is that your sister's...?
Doc," Even though I understand what happened logically, emotionally, I haven't straighten things out. I am sorry, Serge.. Please give me a little more time. I would be just a burden to you in this state, man."
System,
Peppor, I-If you want to shake it on past us...
Solt, You most definitely must bring Karsh here!
Peppor, S-Sir Karsh...! Y-You actually shook it here!
Solt, Do you knowingly know why we are here...?
Karsh, Hell NO! WHAT!? Am I supposed to...!?
Peppor, Don't shake ignorance!
Solt, We came to investigate what happened here!!!
Karsh, ......!!!
Peppor," Sir Karsh! W-We have stood by your side, unable to shake loose this one suspicion we had..."
Karsh, Suspicion...!?
Solt, We believe you may have killed Sir Dario!
Peppor," And by shaking it here, our suspicion has turned to conviction! S-Sir Karsh... We are executing you for the murder of Sir Dario!"
Karsh, Dario...
Riddel," How is your training going, everyone?"
Dario, Miss Riddel!
Riddel, I brought something special for everyone today...
Glenn," Oh, really? What is it, what is it? Viper Churros?"
Riddel," Wrong answer, Glenn. Next? Are they really that good?"
Glenn, Uh-huh! I can chomp down ten of those easily!
Dario, Hahaha... You're always like that. Those churros were originally iron rations for knights. Overeating is not good discipline.
Dario," So, Miss Riddel, what have you brought us? Please don't make us hold our breath too long."
Riddel, This is it! I found it in Fossil Valley. Isn't it pretty?
Glenn," Ah shoot, it's just a flower!"
Dario," Miss Riddel, did you go to the valley by yourself...?"
Riddel," What, I'm not allowed to? It's just the valley, I'm sure it's safe enough."
Dario, ......
Riddel," I have enough for everyone; I will give some to you boys! Glenn doesn't want any, right?"
Glenn," Since you've gone through the trouble of getting it, I'll take one, too! If I plant its seeds, I might get some good fruit from it!"
Riddel," Oh, how silly of you, Glenn!"
Riddel," Here you go, Glenn. But I don't think it will grow any fruit, though."
Glenn, You don't know until you try!
Riddel," Karsh might not like things like flowers, but..."
Karsh," ...... N-No, it's not that..."
Dario," You brought me one, too. This is beautiful... What kind of flower could this be?"
Riddel, It is a 'bellflower.'
Dario," Miss Riddel, if you ever wish for this flower, I will go for you instead. If anything should happen to you..."
Riddel, Then let us go together. Does that sound like a good idea?
Dario," ...... Yes, very well."
Dario, ...Karsh? Are you listening?
Karsh," Huh...? Oh, sorry. So what is it? What's with the formality?"
Dario," ...U-Umm. How should I... Actually, I..."
Karsh, Why are ya acting so strange? Spit it out...
Dario, ...A-Ay. To tell you the truth...
Riddel," Karsh, we are pledged to marry. I have already told daddy about it..."
Dario," Th-That is what I wanted to tell you... Will you bless us with your approval, Karsh?"
Karsh," ...? Marry...? S-So that's it! Well, congratulations! So when's it gonna be, and where?"
Dario," We haven't decided on a date yet. We still need to finish surveying the Isle of the Damned, first. It's just that..."
Karsh, Just what...?
Dario," I want the wedding here. The place where we have cried together, laughed together, and shared our dreams...together."
Karsh," Grin You never change, Dario. Hey, then I'll have to fill this dull vacant lot with loads of bellflowers. Just tell me if I can help ya in any way."
Dario," ...Thank you, Karsh."
Karsh, This must be it!
Dario," Karsh, why are you in such a hurry? The enemy is not going anywhere, and the footing here is bad..."
Karsh," Why do you always have to be like that, Dario? The Masamune may be in there! Any dragoon would be hyped to see that thing! You know!?"
Dario, ......
Karsh," Shaker Brothers, you stay here."
Solt, Sir!
Peppor, S-Sir!
Karsh," Let's get goin', Dario."
Dario, Fine...
Karsh, Is that... the Masamune!?
Karsh," Was I really just possessed by that devilish sword...? Driven by such intense hatred and envy...? Maybe deep inside me, I was filled with hatred? Dario, the one whom I could never beat, no matter how much I tried...the one who stole Riddel's heart from me..."
Karsh, What if that sword does not imbed hatred into the mind of its wielder... but instead draws out and ignites the flames of hatred hidden within the hearts of men...? And if that hatred was something deep within the wielder to begin with...? Then what have I...?
Glenn, ......
Peppor, S-So you do know something about it!
Karsh, Take it easy...! Why the hell do I have to fight you guys!?
Solt, No time for questions!
Karsh, Tch! What the hell!?
Peppor, R-Running away!?
Solt, Makes him look even more suspiciously suspicious!
Karsh," Listen, I don't wanna fight you!!!"
System, Karsh learned Axiomatic!
Karsh, Listen to me... I did not kill Dario... I know the time will come when I can speak the truth. But I can't just yet... I hope you understand.
Peppor," Sir Karsh...! I have come to an understanding after that battle we just had... You are not an evil person. You would never kill your best friend! Please forgive us... Looking back now, you were the one who took us under your wing, even though we were dragoon outcasts. You are very special to us, Sir Karsh!"
Solt," Sob...! We believe you, Sir Karsh...! We must be on our way, but we hope to see you again, sometime, somewhere... When that time comes, we hope you will be readily ready to tell us what really happened!"
Peppor, A-And... We're sorry we took this from you. We're shaking it back to you.
System, Karsh received MementoPendant!
Karsh," ...Thanks. I'll take good care of it. One day, I promise to tell you guys the truth... Take care."
System, Orcha received DinnerGuest!
Starky, Where did youu catch this fish?

System, Received Funguy's Myconoids!
Fargo," Hey, you. The concert's over. Now my Marbule will fall into decay and become just an eternal dream... Hahhahah!!!"
Fargo, You land-lubber...! You're pitiful!!!
Fargo," Call me what you want, but it's too late now... We can't turn back time. Now let go of me!"
Fargo, Tch!!!
Fargo, ......
Fargo, Irenes... Looks like your last hope has evaporated. This is how it should be. Everything will cease to exist... Only the beautiful memories will remain.
System, The Black Dragon remains asleep...
Nikki," Oh, it's you! We're all set to go! All we have to do now is convince my father to take this ship to Marbule... But that's the hardest part. I wonder if there's anyone out there who can convince him? If so... it would have to be someone with a genuine heart, like the father I used to know."
Nikki, ......!!! Father! What are you doing here? Have you changed your mind?
Fargo, Arg! I'll take care of this. I have ta manage me own affairs.
Nikki, ......?
Nikki," Well, Irenes? Did you find anyone who might be able to bring Fargo back to reality?"
Fargo, Arg! I'll take care of this. I have ta manage me own affairs.
Fargo, Arg! Leave it ta me.
Luccia, Of course... But vot dat child really needs is a loving family. I cannot provide dat...
Marcy, You knew my mom...?
Marcy, ......
Fargo," Aye, land-lubber...!"
Fargo," Are you, me...?"
Fargo," Don't even associate yerself with me...! You're bein' a sissy, Fargo! You're pathetic!!! I, too, had the possibility of becomin' a jelly-belly like yerself!"
Fargo, ......
Fargo," I know about the plan... We're movin' this ship along with Nikki's to Marbule and showerin' the island with his song at full volume... Once the dream spirits awaken, we'll defeat 'em one by one..."
Fargo," My ship, the Zelbess... This ship can no longer set sail... I can't steer it..."
Fargo, Hah! Who's askin' ya anyway?
Fargo," Listen up, mateys! This ship is no longer the Zelbess but the S.S. Invincible! Set the course for Marbule, and man yer stations...!"
Fargo, It's useless...
Fargo, We'll see about that!
Fargo, H-How the...!?
Fargo, Ya don't even know that!? The desire to return to one's home is steerin' this ship forward...
Fargo, You mean the demi-humans...?
Fargo," Once this ship reaches Marbule, Nikki will begin his concert. We gotta do what we can to wake those monsters from their nightmare... So long, Fargo... I've come to me senses. It's time you did the same."
Nikki," Adrift, adrift, adrift... From how many dreams have I awakened? How many morrows have passed...? The days when victory meant everything have ~ come to an end... ~ Yesterday's friends become ~~ tomorrow's foes... ~~ So flow the days filled with betrayal and enmity... Once one reaches the summit, all that remains is one's ~    inevitable downfall... ~   All has become lost...   ~ The innumerable wounds, once decorations of glory, have begun instead to ache... Aaah, have I awoken...? Where might I be...? Could this be the Grave of the Narwhales that is said to lie hidden in the seas? Where am I!? So...I am all alone. Just deserts for the likes of me... Betrayed by the very ones in whom I trusted... Gone are the friends with whom I shared my dreams... Alone, with no lover to share my sorrows..."
Nikki, Is someone thither?
Nikki, Be it thou...? My savior sweet?
Nikki, Be thou not a mere maiden but a... mer-maiden?
Nikki," Only that one such as thee would help a human like me... My eternal gratitude is thine, sweet siren of the sea..."
Nikki, 'Tis too sad a tale to tell one so fair...
Nikki, Pleasure...?
Nikki," A song...? Of such a thing I know naught... Wherefore wouldst thou hear my croonings, Neptunian nymph? Surely there is naught to be gained from it!?"
Nikki," So thou sayest... Unfortunately, singing has no relevance to me. I long ago forgot how to laugh and how to cry. How awfully nostalgic!? I feel as though I have heard that song before, somewhere, long ago. A mysterious melody that bathes thee in a warm glow..."
Nikki, Hold on! Such a thing I cannot do!
Nikki, Wait! Do not go! Sigh...! As I thought... I am unable to perform such music!
Nikki," Please, I beg ye! Teach me how to sing."
Nikki, Well... What dost thou think?
Nikki, Lo! The stars doth twinkle in accord with our song... The brighter one is the Star of Diarmuid... And next to it the Star of Grania can be seen shining so faintly... We mariners navigate our vessels by these two stars!
Nikki, I didn't realize that stars could look so beautiful... I never took the time to gaze at them like this before... Nor ever heard the song that they had been singing unto me. Now that I have spent what seems like days singing here with thee... I have come to realize that there is more than what seems be... The twinkling of the stars... The waving of the waves... Even silence itself... All sing in harmony with thee and me.
Nikki," Speaking of which, I must soon return to my world."
Nikki, My pursuers are nigh... My staying here will endanger thy folk...
Nikki," I cannot allow such a thing! One step out of here lie treacherous tempests and woeful warfare. Yet, even then... Even then, thou dost say thou shalt come with me?"
Nikki," Then comest thou to me, my sweet sea sprite... Until the whole world hath come to live in heavenly harmony... Upon that day shall I bring thee back to this idyllic isle. Then... Then and only then... Will both our worlds have peace between nature and humanfolk... And resonate in chorus with our anthem dear. Together, let us build that whole new world... Come my maiden, come...!"
Fargo, ......
Fargo," Oh, Zelbess... Does this song call out to your heart? You taught me this song... For a long time, I've been trying to regain what I've lost, but to no avail... But now... I feel as if the one important thing has finally returned... Thanks to the irreplaceable treasure you left behind."
Fargo," So you're happy for me, too..."
Fargo," Even though she said that... I, too, was unable to fulfill the promise I made Zelbess... Her dream is also my dream... Zelbess... I promised never to use this attack again, but there is no avoiding it... Please forgive me... This time, I will protect you!"
System, Fargo broke the seal of Invincible!
Fargo, Alright then...!!! I'll show you how serious I can get! It's time for me to let loose in Marbule!
System, Board your boat? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System, A dragon's cry was heard in the far-off distance...
Nikki," Thank you... Words cannot express how I feel inside... This event has allowed me to see myself differently. I hope to share this feeling with not only humans, but with all living creatures..."
Nikki," What a surpise to see you here, Miki. You never come here."
Nikki, Marcy...
Marcy, WHAT-EVER!
Nikki, ......
Nikki," Thank you for opening my father's eyes to reality... I'm sure Marbule will thrive with beauty again. When that day comes, I would like to perform there again..."
Fargo," No, Nikki... I'm the one who needs to give thanks. She's also a manifestation of myself. That's why I'm able to understand her feelings... But I can't keep that feeling bottled up forever. That's what she helped me realize. All thanks to you..."
Nikki, ......
Nikki," How's the restoration of Marbule goin', Irenes?"
Nikki, Rockin'... There will always be a place in my heart for that song.
System, Miki joined your party!
Sneff," What do you want!? I paid you offf, didn't I!? Or are you here to borrow money!?"
Fargo, Arg... Who's this old-timer?
Peppor, I-I've seen him before!
Solt, That flashingly flashy uniform... He must be a fellow stage performer from before we lost our memory!
Karsh, What are you bozos talkin' about!?
Peppor, H-He's an angry one!
Solt, I do not think he'll be one of our apprentices!
Old Man, Th-Th-This can't be...!? Miki...!? Are you for real!?
Old Man, Aiiiii-ya!!! O-O-Of course! I'll scream my lungs out cheering you on!
Member," If we show him that emblem, we might be able to gain his trust."
Man, Th-That is a Dragon Emblem!? How did a foreigner like you get a hold of it...
Steena, Welcome... Travellers across the dimensions... ~ Bring them before me.
Man," Yes, if it is your wish, Miss Steena... You have permission from the chief. You may pass, foreign travelers."
Man," Foreign travelers, please excuse my earlier conduct. You may enter the tower. Please mind your manners with Chief Steena..."
Man," I don't know how you got hold of the emblem, but our chief granted you permission. You may enter the tower..."
Steena," Let me make this clear, Serge.. Seek the eldest beings on"
Man," May you have the guidance of the great 6 Dragon Gods on the road ahead... Chief, please be careful."
Glenn, Sir Lynx...? Exactly what happened up there in the fort?
Glenn, Miss Riddel... I am at a loss for what to believe... I plan to leave the Dragoons for a while...
Riddel," I understand... But please, do not put yourself into danger... Everyone in the Dragoons is worried about your safety..."
Glenn, ......
Glenn, General... I... I am deeply sorry for my selfish conduct. I am prepared for expulsion from the Dragoons...
Viper," What are you saying, Glenn. I am the one who needs to apologise. Like your brother Dario, you have the same calm eyes that see the big picture without being led astray. And that is exactly what the Dragoons are in need of now..."
Glenn, General...
Karsh," Glenn, come on, let's go! We need as many hands as possible right now!"
Glenn," Sorry, Karsh... but I cannot follow the Dragoons now. I need some time to think on my own..."
Karsh," Heh, you're beginning to sound similar to your big bro!"
Glenn, Master Zappa...
Zappa," Glenn, ye're alright. Ah no can tell ye how relieved ah am!"
Glenn," Sir Radius... Sometimes I can not tell right from wrong. Right now, I do not know what is going on or what I can do about it... What would Dario do if he were here..."
Radius, Hoh hoh hoh...! There is no need to worry. It seems Dario's spirit lives strongly within you. Believe in yourself and do what you believe.
Man, Yes?
Radius, Impossible! Dario!? You are alive!
Karsh, DARIO! Is it really you!? What the...!? So you're actually alive in this world!
Viper," Impossible! Is that you, Dario!? This is remarkable... So you are alive in this world."
Marcy, No way! Are you Dario!? You're alive... Of course you are! You're Dario!
Luccia," You... Are you Dario? So you are alive in dis vorld. yes, it all makes perfect sense."
Zoah, D-DARIO! YOU ARE ALIVE IN THIS WORLD!
Radius, Dario! I don't believe this...
Karsh, Dario! That's right... We're in another world.
Viper," Dario, it is you! So, you are alive..."
Marcy," Hey, it's Dario! I knew Dario couldn't die!"
Luccia," Dario! yes, it makes sense dat you vould be alive in anotter vorld."
Zoah, D-DARIO! YOU ARE ALIVE!
Man, Are you saying you know who I am?
Radius, What? You do not recognize me?
Karsh," Cut the crap, Dario! Of course we know!"
Viper, You do not know who you are?
Marcy," So, like, what are you sayin'!? No time for games!"
Luccia, Dario... Have you...
Zoah, HUH? DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
Woman," Do you know this man? It has been 4 years since this man washed ashore, clinging on for dear life. Every day was a battle between life and death, but miraculously, he made it. However, this man has no recollection of his past whatsoever..."
Glenn, Impossible! Brother! But how...!? I understand... You are alive in this world.
Radius," Hmmm... Well, it was a miracle that he survived... I guess this cannot be helped."
Riddel, This cannot be... Are you...Dario!? But of course you are. This is another world. You are alive and well in this world!
Karsh, Dario! I'm your buddy Karsh! Don't you remember!?
Viper, Good lord! So you do not remember a thing?
Marcy, C'mon! You don't remember me?
Luccia, A case of amnesia resulting from his injuries. Dis could be bad.
Zoah, THIS IS TERRIBLE...
Dario, Forgive me... I just cannot remember.
Glenn, Brother! You are alive!
Radius, What can we do? Yes! Perhaps he will remember if we bring Riddel here.
Karsh, Damn...! What can we do? Hey! What if we bring Lady Riddel here? He might remember then!
Riddel," What did you say!? No, this cannot be..."
Viper," What can we do? Yes, my daughter, Riddel, may help him remember!"
Marcy," So, like, what can we do? Oh yeah! Maybe he'll remember if we bring Riddel here!"
Luccia," Somet'ing to stimulate his memory... yes, perhaps if ve bring Riddel here..."
Glenn," Brother! Don't you remember me!? I am your brother, Glenn!"
Zoah, WHAT CAN WE DO? AHA! YES! HE MAY REMEMBER IF WE BRING MISS Riddel HERE.
Dario, My name is Dario...?
Riddel, This cannot be... Are you...Dario!? But of course you are. This is another world. You are alive and well in this world!
Dario, You seem to know me quite well.
Riddel," Yes, Dario. You do not remember me? I may be the Riddel from another world, but every day, I have always... And yet you do not remember who I am?"
Dario, Riddel...? That name moves my heart... I have a feeling I have lost someone very dear to me...
Riddel," If only there was something to reawaken your memory... Yes, I know. Your mother's memento which you gave to me... That may help you remember."
Riddel, Daddy!
Viper," Oh, that... I could not stand seeing you in such sorrow, so I stored it in the secret treasure vault inside the manor."
Riddel, The secret treasure vault? You mean the one inside the east tower?
Viper," Indeed. You should be able to access that room from the 2nd floor, now."
Riddel, But wait. The Shaker Brothers made off with the contents of that treasure chest.
Viper, Those fools... I guess there is no choice but to bring Karsh to the Isle of the Damned.
Riddel, I believe that was... My father could not stand seeing me in sorrow... So he stored it safely away in a secret treasure vault inside Viper Manor.
Member, A secret treasure vault? Where exactly is it?
Riddel, It is in a room inside the east tower. You can access it from the 2nd floor.
Riddel, But wait. The Shaker Brothers made off with the contents of that treasure chest.
Karsh," Damn, those idiots... I guess I'd better make my way down to the Isle of the Damned."
Member, Looks like we'd better head to the Isle of the Damned.
Woman," Doesn't everyone have things in the past they wish to forget? Please, do not torment him any further... We live a quiet life here. Please...leave us alone."
Member, It's useless unless Riddel shows it to him.
Dario, You seem to know me quite well.
Riddel," Yes, Dario. You do not remember me? I may be the Riddel from another world, but every day, I have always... And yet you do not remember who I am?"
Dario, Riddel...? That name moves my heart... I have a feeling I have lost someone very dear to me...
Riddel, This pendant is a memento from your mother... and a gift you gave me when we got engaged.
Dario, This is...
Riddel," Try to remember! We have been together since we were little. And we will continue to be... I will always be there for you, Dario..."
Dario, Riddel... R-Run...
Dario, Aaaaaaargh!
Radius, Th-This is bad!
Woman, W-What...? What's wrong?
Radius, No! Don't touch him!
Woman, AHHHHHH!
Karsh, What the...!?
Karsh, The Masamune!
Glenn," Brother, what are you talking about!?"
Riddel, Dario!
Riddel," No, Dario! Do not touch that sword!"
Radius, I knew it! The Masamune never actually disappeared from Death Gate. It just returned to its rightful owner.
Karsh, Wait a minute! Then that means Dario's still...
Radius, What really happened!? I thought Dario died fighting demons on the Isle of the Damned!?
Karsh, Actually...
Karsh, Is that... the Masamune!?
Karsh, Dario!? What do you think you're doing!?
Dario, ...... DIE!
Karsh," Don't tell me it's that sword...!? Dario, let go!!!"
Dario, Tch...!
Karsh," Stop, Dario!!! It's me! Karsh! Damn!"
Dario," Kill me, Karsh! Hurry...!"
Karsh, N-No...!
Dario," Do it, Karsh!!! Or else, I'll...!"
Karsh," No, Dario! I can't! Please snap out of it, Dario!!!"
Karsh, Who the...!?
Karsh, DAMN YOU...! AHHHHHH...!!!
Karsh, Dario...!!! What have I done...?
Karsh, Y-You are...
Lynx," Dario was killed by demons. Understand, Karsh?"
Karsh, But...
Lynx, Are you going to tell everyone about what you just did? Are you willing to tell Riddel that YOU murdered Dario because he was possessed by the Evil Sword...?
Karsh, ......!
Lynx," Do not worry. Do as I say, and everything will be just fine."
Karsh, Dario...
Radius, Now I understand...
Radius," Dario was possessed by the enmity of the Masamune, too."
Radius, Prepare yourselves!
Karsh, I guess there's no way outta this!
Riddel, I cannot face Dario in battle!
Glenn," Me, neither! I just found my brother! No, I cannot do this..."
Radius," To abolish the darkness, we must defeat the Masamune! It is the only way to save Dario!"
Radius, Do not give in to its enmity! Cast off the darkness!
Karsh, We can't just run from it! We have to settle this here!
Radius, Hmph! It appears the Masamune found a new master.
Karsh, What!? Lynx!!!?
Radius, Do not panic. Look around you.
Riddel, Birds...! The birds that fled are coming back!
Radius, I no longer sense the slightest bit of malice from the Masamune. There is no more fear of succumbing to its enmity.
System, Serge's Sea Swallow transformed into the Mastermune.
Dario, Where...am I...?
Dario," Riddel... Is that you, Riddel? What happened to me?"
Riddel, Dario... Thank goodness... Your memory has returned.
Dario," Memory? Oh, yes... I had taken a hold of the Masamune when... Forgive me, Karsh... for what I have put you through."
Karsh," Ahh, forget about it!"
Radius," Although your memory has returned, let us not forget the harsh reality which lies in wait. Come."
Woman, So... You will be leaving... I have been prepared for this day... Farewell... I wish you all the best...
Riddel, Everyone is hurt and separated... Inexperienced and incomplete...
Riddel," However, by living as such, we may change for the better into something bigger... Something more...gentle..."
Dario, My goodness... What has happened during my absence!?
Dario, Where have the general and the others gone?
Dario," Riddel, you said that you all came from another world. Then where are Karsh, you, and the others in this world?"
Radius," Unfortunately, no one from Viper Manor who went to the Dead Sea will return."
Dario, ...Why did the general and the others go to such a dangerous place?
Radius, In search of the Frozen Flame... They were swallowed up by a terminated time line...040 and have perished along with the Dead Sea...
Dario, Sigh... How ironic that it is I who have survived...
Riddel, But Dario... You still have me.
Dario, Riddel...
Riddel," We may be from different worlds, but you are you, and I am I."
Karsh," Yo! That's right! I'm alive and kickin', too! There ain't no one who can take my life! Gah-haha-ha!"
Karsh," Zoah and Marcy are here, too... We can also call the old dragon stable keeper!"
Dario," Thank you, everyone..."
Dario, I guess you are right. I am alive. And I will do whatever I must do.
Dario," I do not know how many years it will take, but I will rebuild Viper Manor. It is my duty."
Radius," My, my, my... Perhaps it's about time I came out of retirement... Time for one last hurrah! Hoh-hoh-hoh!"
Karsh," OH YEAH! Bring it on! Even though we may be from different worlds, the 4 Devas are back in business!"
Glenn, Brother! I've matured into quite a swordsman in the past 4 years!
Karsh," But...maybe minus 1. I don't think you're fit for battle, yet."
Dario, Forgive me... 4 years of isolation have taken their toll.
Riddel, Are you alright?
Dario, Riddel... I want you to take this.
System, Received Riddel's SnakeFangs!
Riddel, Please rest up and just concentrate on rebuilding Viper Manor.
Dario, Thank you. I shall do so.
Riddel," Of course, I will help you, too. Plus, I have an idea... Ha-hah-ha!"
Norris, So this explains the noise that was coming from above...
Norris, The other soldiers have withdrawn from their posts.
Dario," Hmmm... Well, I did say I would open the doors to all the children who lost their parents during this past struggle... However, this remodeling job is a little too..."
Riddel, We have to bear in mind that children will be living here. Why not officially make this place into an orphanage?
Riddel," Well, daddy?"
Viper, Errr... Hmmm...
Girl," Some swings would be nice, too. Please, Headmaster!?"
Girl," This is my house! Huge, isn't it? I hope we all can live together soon! Don't you agree, Headmaster?"
Girl," We can play a serious game of hide-and-seek with a yard this big! C'mon, let's play, Headmaster!"
Viper, Who are you calling Headmaster!?
Member, Serge. The Water Dragon's just beyond here.
System,
Member, We'll be able to make it back if we blow the flute again here.
Member, Father?
Member," We're sorry, Leah, but we don't know your father. By the way... where are we?"
Member, What was that? ...The Green Dragon?
System, Leah temporarily joined-um party!
System, You used up the Ancient Fruit...
Member, Why's it so quiet?
Member, ......!? Leah!
System,
Member, Leah...?
System, Leah officially joined-um party!
System, It won't budge... No use staying here.
Member, What is this thing? We can't get through with this in the way.
Member, Can't we just push this thing out of the way?
Member," The thing won't budge. I don't think the 3 of us can move it, either."
Member, We should probably head back up for now. There's no use staying here.
System,
Member, It's not attacking... Maybe we can use the explosives on this thing?
System,
Member," Looks like the same one that was blocking the path... Even if you touch it, it won't attack."
System, Looks like you can push it. ~~~Push it ~~~Leave it alone
Member, Looks like it's a dead end.
Member, Could this just be a natural cavern of some sort? It doesn't seem like a ruin.
Member, There's no point staying here. There's absolutely nothing.
System,
Member," We made it up, but how are we supposed to get down?"
Member, Maybe if we just jump down like we did before?
System, Jump down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System,
System, Member received the Black Relic.
System, Member received the White Relic!
Steena," As promised, I will lend you the Dragon Tear. I shall accompany you to the fort as well."
System, Steena joined your party!
Steena, May the 6 Dragon Gods bestow protection upon we children of the planet...
Steena," Now, take the Dragon Tear with you...to the 'Room of Rituals' in Fort Dragonia."
Steena," ...Chief Direa, it is a pleasure to see you again."
Steena," It is a strange feeling to be facing myself. An alternate world... Whether you will discover the future of mankind at the end of your journey is uncertain, but I will pray for your success."
Steena," There is no one here who can foresee the future of the battle... The battle between Dragons, humans, and fate... Will humans change the world, or is the world fated to change..."
Steena, ...All creation is guided by fate.
Steena, I feel your pain... deep within my soul... I understand... I shall fall heir to your dream...
System, Steena received GaraiShadow!
Steena, I shall fall heir to your dream... Please rest in peace.
Member, The Dragon relics aren't responding...
Member, Maybe Serge has to return to his human form.
Steena, Place the Dragon Tear here... The fort shall open itself up for you...
Serge, Heh... So you finally made it. But this is as far as you will get... It's a little too soon for you to get your original form back.
Serge," Heh heh heh... Give it up, Serge. Everything is merely a dream."
Serge, Heh... It's no use.
Serge," Impressive... I may have underestimated you. Anyway, I must get on with my affairs. Besides, it's too late...! Good-bye, Serge..."
System, ~~~Go up ~~~Go down ~~~Stay
System, It's some kind of device. It's still operating...
System, Draggy joined yourrr parrrty!
System, It's some kind of device...
System, ~~~Go Up ~~~Stay
Steena," Serge... You must proceed alone from here. You must see and confirm for yourself who you really are... Truth shall manifest itself, once you believe in your heart."
Member, Serge!!!
Steena," Serge.... You have regained your identity without being led astray. Your eyes, which foresaw the truth, shall help you to regain your trust among your comrades... There is nothing we can do about the Dragon Tear... Its shattering result does not come as a surprise. However, you also carry the fate of the Dragon Tear from another world. The broken pieces of"
System, The Dragon Tear shattered but transformed into the Tear of Love!
Doc," ...You want me to have this book? Hmm, now this is interesting..."
Doc," ......!? What...is this... I-I cannot believe this...! Humans, demi-humans, animals, you name it. The bio-structure of every living organism in this world is listed in full detail... H-How can this be?"
Doc," ...What did you say? You brought this book from the future? ...... There are still many things beyond science in this world... Hahaha, the future sure holds many surprises!"
Doc," Should we say this medical book is a 'legacy of the future' ...per se? But, Serge., are you sure you want me to keep this book?"
Doc," I see, thank you, dude. The future of medical science... I will put it to good use."
System, Doc has learned HangTen!
Korcha," Hey you, can ya hear me? If you don't try to getCHA self outta there, nobody's ever goin' to help ya. Do ya get that?"
Korcha, Who the CHA are you? I don't remember doin' anythin' to be thanked for.

Macha, Cha-ha-ha! You're right. I'm embarassed to have said such a thing.
Macha," When you reach my age, you've seen everything. But I'm stunned to find another me. I never expected that! Cha-ha-ha!"
Macha," Well, you kids must have a lot of things to take care of, but do your best and hang in there!"
System, There's a paper on the ground with some writing on it. ~~~Not interested ~~~Read it I'm not in right now. If you need me for something... don't bother looking for me. ~ ~~~Mel
Korcha," Well, if she's just like you, I'd say she's out causin' some mischief."

Woman," Hmmm, oh well. You've got a deal!"
Zappa, Sounds interesting... Good timing too. Ah've just finished an order. We'll see what ah can do...
Zappa, So this is the... Rainbow Axe!!!
Zappa," Hmm, it's probably radiating such beautiful colors because of its prismatic nature... The response from the hammer is as satisfying as its finish. It be truly an amazing material..."
Zappa, We should be able to do this on our own next time... That sure was a brilliant job. Ah hope ah can work with ye again!
System, Zappa learned how to forge the rainbow material!

Viper, ...... I must have been fooling myself. Pretending I was a good lord... I am not worthy of being honoured with such a large statue. I am just a fool chasing his own desires.

System, Prehysteric dropped something...
Member, If this is an altar of the Divine Dragon worshipers... then maybe Steena knows something. about it.
Steena, By the Great Dragon Gods!!! The sacrarium of the Divine Dragon Falls still exists...and it seems functional! It's just as the legends of old said it would be! What a blessing!
Steena," Utilizing its power, we just may be able to create the 'Chrono Cross' here!"
Steena, Try placing the two pieces of the Dragon Tear... The Tear of Hate and the Tear of Love... on these stands.
Steena, Try placing a piece of the Dragon Tear on this stand.
Steena, We need the other piece of the Dragon Tear before we can accomplish anything.
Steena," Great Dragon Gods! We are yet unable to utilize the altar...? I know that we need the six Dragon Relics that offer up divine supplication... Could 'that' legend be true... Is there a seventh dragon, and a seventh Element...!?!"
Steena," When the time is ripe, we shall be able to generate Elements here!"
System, It seems that you cannot do it yet.
Doc, This voice...? It is so familiar. But something is different... who is this?
Doc," ......!? Tia, is that you Tia? What the...?"
Doc, Tia's twin sister...? H-Hold on a sec! What exactly is going on?
Doc," ...Your eyes tell me you speak the truth. I understand, I will permit you to visit, but realize one thing... It will be a painful reunion... Orlha."
Doc, ...Alright. Then let me take you to her.
Doc," As you can ascertain, dude... Our voices cannot reach her, no matter how hard we try... We do not even have a firm diagnosis of what caused her to become unconscious and collapse... Time has mercilessly passed by, while she continues to slumber."
Doc, Another world? You mean to say such a thing exists? Truly bodacious...
Doc, So the other me standing in my presence has come from another dimension...
Doc," So the other me who came by to visit... He came from the other world, too?"
Doc," Hey, me from the other world... You and Orlha come from the same world, I presume?"
Doc, There is an infinite number of worlds. The world we live in now is just one of the many...
Doc," A miracle, brought together by a bond spanning two worlds... It is truly unbelievable, for such a thing to really occur..."
Doc," Orlha... As Tia said in her final words... She will always be with you. Even though your worlds are different, you two are truly sisters. That will never change..."
Doc, This was Tia's. ...Take it with you.
Doc," I heard Tia talk about this gem before... I can only give it to you. Tia's spirit will always be with you, along with this blue gem... Now, Orlha, open your hands."
System, The split gem has become one and regained its blue sparkle. Orlha received the Blue Brooch.
System, Orlha has learned SisterHoods!
Doc, Tia's spirit will always be with you. Keep cool...Orlha...
Doc," Death is the total wipeout. All life must face death eventually... There is no escaping it. But, because life has limits, one can live strongly."
Porre Soldier," This knight Glenn I hear is an extremely hot-tempered and hard-headed guy. My, my, that's why prehistoric soldiers like knights are such a nuisance."
Glenn, What was that!? Try squeaking that line out again!
Porre Soldier," Huh, are you a knight also? That's why I say knights are so foolish."
Glenn, Tsk!
Glenn, ......? The Einlanzer is resonating...?
Glenn," Brother...!? Yes, I understand. This sword I will take into my hands... And together, we will fulfill our unfinished dream!"
System, Glenn has succeeded the Einlanzer!
Member, Are we being tested?
System, Atropos has stopped functioning. Lachesis has stopped functioning. Clotho has stopped functioning.
System, There seems to be some trick to opening it.
System, Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Norris, This is...! StrongArm!
Norris," I thought I destroyed it when I caused the explosion in the lab... In any case, the only one who can operate this is Grobyc."
Norris, I must bring Grobyc here.
Luccia," I cannot believe dis...! It is an ancient super veapon. I do recall my brotter talking about dis. ...About a super veapon that vas excavated near an ancient ruin. According to him, dere vere not enough parts to complete it, but dis shows othervise. Dis vould have been Grobyc's exclusive veapon. I must bring Grobyc here."
Luccia, Only Grobyc knows how to use it.
System, There's a mysterious being inside.
Member, We have to bring someone here that knows what this is.
System, Received Grobyc's StrongArm!

Member, Does this device playback archives?
Member, Looks like someone's memoirs.
Kid," Radical Dreamers...!? And me name's on here, too! What the bloody hell is goin' on?"
Kid, And here's a passage with me and me old mates.
Member, What's this...!?
Member, Radical Dreamers...!? What does this mean?
Member, There's a conversation with a comrade.
Kid, ...... This seems to be an archive from a different time than our own.
Kid, Aside from the two worlds we already know about... there may be other worlds and times which exist...
Member, ...... This seems to be an archive from a different time than our own.
Member," Aside from the two worlds we already know about, other worlds and times may also exist..."
Member, So that's why!!!
Member, So that's why Lynx needed Serge's form!
Member, Lynx must be inside already.
Member, Yes. ...Along with the Frozen Flame.
Member, Where are we...!?
Member, Is that... the Frozen Flame!?
Lynx, Exactly.
Member, ......!?
Lynx," The hearer of people's prayers... The provider of riches, fame, and power... The bestower of eternal life... The promiser of peace and happiness..."
Lynx, This is the essence of what descended from the heavens in the prehistoric age. The living crimson stone... the Frozen Flame!
Member, Lynx!?
Lynx, What took you so long? You had me worried. Worried that you might have perished on the way here.
Member, Are you alright?
Lynx, It's no use. I put her soul to sleep. I had to remove any potential obstacle from us having this talk.
Member, Who are you!? What are you after!?
Lynx," You still don't know? I am the human incarnation of FATE... The living interface of the FATE computer system... Or put simply... I, too, am FATE!"
Member, What!?
Lynx," 14 years ago, on the night of a terrible storm, the cogs began to turn. That night, Wazuki and Miguel set out to sea carrying a sick, young child in their boat. That child was you, Serge, after you had been attacked by that panther demon. Your poisoned wounds were beyond the healing abilities of the doctors in Termina or even Guldove. So they set sail to Marbule in order to see the sage there...not knowing how bad the storm would become. Being skilled sailors, the two men were able to survive the storm. But they were blown off course and came ashore on this island, where they decided to seek shelter. At the time, this research center was off-line due to the severity of the storm. It only took 10 minutes for the system to power back up, but by then, the Flame had found you..."
Lynx," Contact with the Flame healed your young body. But that was not all... Once the security card system was rebooted, it would only grant access to you...the 'arbiter.' You can't imagine the trouble this caused the FATE computer system in achieving its objective. Inside of FATE, there was a stand-alone circuit that had been kept hidden since the old Mother Brain generation. That circuit was designed to start a malfunction, or more precisely, a 'rebellion.'"
Lynx," Who would have thought that such a small bug, a 'traitor,' could exist inside of FATE? That hidden circuit was based on the initial Ashtear model circuit board, with extra logic added by another scientist. FATE itself did not realize that this circuit was present within the core of its system. Or, more correctly... ...the circuit was programmed so that the moment FATE did detect it, it would erase all record of its detection."
Lynx," Dr. Lucca Ashtear... Unbelievably intelligent, and incredibly enthusiastic. You might even go so far as to call her a mad scientist. Of course I don't believe it was Lucca alone that devised this plan. I'm sure the first curator of this research center, a man named Belthasar, had a hand in it, too."
Lynx," FATE! Bring out the traitor, Prometheus..."
Lynx, FATE! Eliminate him.
Member, No! You can't...
Lynx, Idiot. Destruction to those who oppose the Goddess of Fate!
Member, ...... Lynx... Why you...!
Lynx," Hah... Come, Serge! Show me what the purpose of your life on this planet is... Teach me what it means to be 'alive!!!'"
Lynx, Is THAT the meaning to your life...?
Lynx, ~- - - COMMENCING COUNTDOWN - - -~ ~~~~~~~~5~~~~~~~~ - - - RECOMMENCING COUNTDOWN - - - ~~~~~~~~~5~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~4~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~3~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~2~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~1~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~0~~~~~~~~
Lynx, Nooo! How could you...? I... FATE... the Goddess of Fate... was not meant to die...
Kid, Ah...! Huh...? Where in blazes am I?
Kid, Serge... What happened to me?
Kid, Aha!? That...? That's it!!!
Harle, NON!!! Arrêt!
Harle, Ne touchez pas! Do not touch it!
Harle, Kid! I know ze feelingz you have inside of you... Ze urge to bring everyt'ing to not'ing iz now stronger zan your dezire to save everyone. You may want to t'row yourself down ze cliff of destruction... Zat iz your impératif.
Harle," But s'il vous plaît, Kid... Do not drag Serge and ze odderz down into destruction wit' you!"
Kid," Shut up, ya looney! I know what I'm doin'! It's too late! There's no turnin' back now!"
Kid, Terra Tower... It's come back to life again...!
Kid," In the year 2400, during a counter-time experiment, the Flame goes out of control... This causes the dimensions to rip apart, resultin' in the Time Crash. Engulfed in an enormous dimensional vortex, Chronopolis was hurled ten thousand years back in time. Perhaps it was the awakenin' Lavos who pulled the Frozen Flame back through time to it. Maybe so that Lavos, who saw the possibility that some young adventurers might destroy it, could create a backup plan."
Kid," But that ain't all... At the same time, another city from a different dimension's future, was also thrown back in time. Dinopolis... The future city of the Reptites -- Azala's descendants, who had evolved more closely with the planet. Just as Lavos, in an attempt to save itself, summoned Chronopolis from the distant future... Perhaps our planet beckoned Dinopolis into the past... maybe as a measure against Chronopolis and humanity."
Kid," It wasn't the Dragon Gods who sealed up the Frozen Flame! It was FATE, which used the Flame's power to divide and seal the Dragons in slumber! And now that FATE has been defeated, the Dragons will join together again to start their revenge!"
Harle, I feared it would come to zis... I didn't want to have to fight wit' you if it could have been avoided!
Harle," Adieu, Serge! Adieu!"
Karsh, Give me a frickin' break! You mean to tell me we were bein' used all this time!?
Fargo, Yeah...
Karsh, Damn!!!
Viper," ...... What is done is done. Although we may not like it... In any case, we need to make our way into that floating tower."
Riddel, Yes. We cannot just twiddle our thumbs and do nothing.
Viper, The only problem is...
Fargo," So, we have ta find a way up there, right? It's not like the great S.S. Invincible can make it up there, either..."
Riddel, There has to be a way.
Glenn," Yes, the world has infinite possibilities. There has to be something that will help us reach that tower."
Viper," Hmmm... At least our objective is clear. I do not know how, but we must find a way."
Marcy," So, like...whatever happened to Kid after that?"
Karsh, Doesn't look like she'll ever wake up...
Zoah, INDEED. SHE IS RESTING AT RADIUS'S PLACE.
Glenn," Well, at least she can rest quietly there. Plus, Radius will watch over her."
Riddel, Her spirit seems to be possessed by the past. A powerful item is necessary in order to dispel it.
Glenn, ...... Something like the Dragon Tear or the Masamune...?
Riddel, Yes...
Karsh, No use just mopin' around here.
Viper," Indeed, we have much to do. However, time will not wait."
Fargo," Then we have to take action. Let's shove off, mateys!"
System, A piece of the Dragon Tear rests on this stand.
System, The Chrono Cross seems to be responding to the unstable dimension... Serge called his former party members from the other dimension!
System, Go back to Hydra Marshes? ~~~Yes ~~~Not yet

System, Dragon's power doesn't seem to work here...
Kid," It's burning...! Our 'home' is burning! Lucca... All my friends... They're, they're...!! Why...? Why did this happen!? You... Are you going to go away? Are you going to leave me? I'm going to be left all on my own again, aren't I? Everybody I have ever loved has gone far, far away... ~~~I'm sorry...! ~~~I won't leave you! No! Don't leave me! What'll happen to me? Really!? Do you mean that? Your cheek... It's wet...? Thank you... Thank you for saving me... Will I... Will I ever see you again? What? Where did you go...? No! Come back!!! Don't leave me... Please, no...! Don't leave me all alone! ......!!!"
Kid, Serge... How've you been...? I'm...right here...
System, Kid joined your party again!
Radius, Thank goodness... This must be the power of Serge's love. Hoh-hoh-hoh!!!
Radius," Ahh yes, Kid. Luccia is waiting for you in her lab in Viper Manor. She wanted to give you something."
Radius," Anyway, there's no rush. I suggest you rest here for the day."
Kid, What...? My wound...?
Kid, Lynx stabbed me...? What are you talking about?
Kid," Ohhh...wait a minute... Not again... I lose my memory sometimes. Whenever I'm in a dangerous situation where I might get hurt, I just seem to disappear and vanish. And when I come to, I wake up somewhere safe without a single scratch. But the thing is, I can't remember what happened. I don't get it..."
Kid," Anyway, it's happened to me plenty o' times in the past, so it's nothin' to worry about!"
Kid," C'mon, mate! Let's go!"
Radius, I am so glad... I do not want you to experience the pain of losing someone very dear.
Luccia, Kid... I vish to give you somet'ing. Kom to my lab later.
Zappa," Karsh!!! Ohh, Karsh!!!"
Karsh," ...... Unfortunately, I ain't your son. How should I say this... Anyway, YOUR son, Karsh, is no longer in this world. Only that's for sure..."

Karsh," Sorry, mom. We've got no time to rest right now. But I'll be back sometime. So, alright?"
Zappa," Ye must be workin' for the better good. But just remember, ye're no good to anyone dead."
Karsh," Yeah, I got it... You be careful, pops."
Karsh, ......
Zappa, Radius...!? Now that's an auld face ah have no seen for a while... Ah thought ye already retired. What brings ye 'round?
Radius, Hoh hoh hoh... The world around me would not let me rest yet.

System, Received Rainbow Shell.
Luccia," Lucca and I go vay back. Ve vere great friends, both aspiring scientists. Had not the tragic incident occured, I am sure Lucca vould have surpassed me..."
Kid, ......? Where the bloody hell is Nikki? I wanted to ask him somethin'...
Kid, I'm gonna go look for him... Wait here.
Kid," Hey, Nikki... I wanna ask ya somethin'."
Nikki, Yes? What is it?
Kid, It's been botherin' me for a long time... How'd ya come up with the name of your band?
Nikki, Oh...that...
Nikki," Well, there's a story behind it. When I first started out on my own, I couldn't even break the top 100 chart. Inc17001What's even worse was that nobody accepted my looks, or the meaning behind my songs. I was way depressed... I didn't think I had the talent, so I stopped believing in myself. I was this close to quitting..."
Nikki," But one day, a woman stopped by my trailer and said... 'Your songs sing of magical dreams. They're beautiful...' Those words made me so happy... That's when I decided that if I were ever to have my own band, I would name it 'Magical Dreamers!!!'"
Kid, Huh... I think I might have an idea who that woman might be...
Nikki," ......! You know her!? Inc17002Please, tell me who she is! I've been wanting to thank her all these years!"
Kid," ...... One of these days, I'll tell ya. ...When everythin's over."
Nikki," Looks like you have your reasons... OK, then, that's a promise."

Karsh," We gotta find a way into that tower, fast!"
Marcy, Hmph...! I'm so frustrated...!!! I wanna go to that tower and kill everyone!
Riddel, Do you know of the El Nido Triangle? Many rumours have surfaced about that place... Perhaps you should head down there?
Viper, I will not stand for this. We MUST find a way into that tower.
System, Go in? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Member, We have to go find that star child and bring him here.
Member, It won't open.
Member, Does this machine still work?
Member, There must be someone who knows how to operate this thing.
Member," Rumor has it that a star fell into this ocean, along with a star child. Perhaps that child is alive somewhere?"
Member, Then we have to find that star child and bring him here.
Member, We have to bring Starky here.
Member, Is this Starky's ship?
Starky, Woooooow! Starky's ship in this world not brooken! Starky am happy!

Starky, Starky maay bee aable to scrounge up moore stuff. Starky will come back laater.
Starky, Eeasy does it.

Starky," It's an anti-gravity deeviice. If youu attach this to youur booat, it will fly to Terra Tower eeasily."
Starky, All wee neeed now is aa facility to install it.
Member, I remember there was a dock inside of Chronopolis.
Starky, Alriight! Let's bee on our waay to Chroonopoolis.
Starky, Let's seee.
Starky, Starky neeed this and that.
Starky, Oh yeah!
Starky, This should do the trick.

Member, Don't you just have to load that thing on the boat?
Starky, What are youu talking about!? Wee neeed to attach aa staabiliizer to keeep the Autoo-gyroo from spinning out of controol.
Kid," I don't get it... but just hurry it up, okay!?"

System, There's a switch. ~~~Push it ~~~Forget it
Member," Serge, up there..."
Member, That must be the summit.
Member, Look! Those two beams coming from either side... I wonder if they act as some kind of sealing device?
System, It won't open.
Member, Looks like we need to do the same for the other side.
Member, Looks like this is the only way up.
Member, The two beams emitting from either side must be linked to this door.
Kid, So this is the true Frozen Flame... Struth!
Member, So this is the true Frozen Flame...
Kid, Hold on! Don't touch it!
Kid, Is everyone okay?
Member, Is everyone alright?
Kid, Bugger you! Us humans ain't gonna let you have yer way any longer!
Kid, C'mon! Show yer bloody self!
Kid," Whether there's meanin' to our lives or not... we still go on livin', you know!"
Kid, You've got no right to deny that!
Kid, We've gotta beat this bastard...no matter what it takes!
Kid, What in blazes is a Devourer of Time!?
Member, What in the world's A Devourer of Time!?
Kid, Cripey! What in bloody hell's happenin'!?
Member, This place is going to crumble to pieces!
Kid," So that's Terra Tower's final, true form... In the end, we're all the same... Everyone dreams of bein' greater, more powerful..."
Member," So that's Terra Tower's final, true form..."
Member," All life-forms dream of being greater, more powerful..."
Member," We've come this far. All that remains is to defeat the Devourer of Time. Once we wipe the Devourer of Time off the face of this planet, it's all over! Hopefully everything will go back to normal again..."
Kid, You're wrong... Things won't ever go back to the way they were! Destiny... 'Fate'... is dead!
Kid," From now on, us humans have to choose our own way in life... We also have to take responsibility for the choices we do make. And somethin's gotta be done about the way we go on hurtin' and killin' one another! We've gotta settle our differences once and for all!"
Kid," Listen... What's really important is what we do now... The issue ain't whether we defeat that bastard or not! I'm afraid that, dependin' on how we go about it, we could lose out on gainin' somethin' real precious... So the issue is the way we fight!"
Member, So where on earth is the real Devourer of Time?
Kid, My guess is the key to findin' it lies at that beach... That's where this whole thing started. It's also probably where this whole thing'll end.
Van, ...Tsk!
Van, Urgh...
Van, Mom...
Man," Hey, man, sorry. Only Arni residents are allowed through here. They're all taking shelter from the evils of Serge and his minions."
Leena, HEY! BUT I LIVE HERE!
Man," Sorry, but you might be a monster disguised as Leena. I can't let you through. But if you come back without those goons, then maybe I can let you in... I'm sorry."
Leena," Lisa... Don't blame yourself so much. Your father must want to wake up from his sleep. But something is stopping him. I can feel it... So please, try be your normal, cheerful self, alright?"
Peppor, I-It's not like we're in hiding. We're waiting for the right moment to shake an attack.
Peppor, S-Sir Karsh! We were mistaken. You will always be our leader.
Solt," This is really, truly, my house! It is not like we were running or hiding from anything!"
Solt," Oh, it is you, Sir Karsh! We are on your side, sir. Once the dragoon forces reorganize, we will rejoin you!"
Steena, May the blessing of the Goddess of Fate be upon we children of the planet...
Starky, Starky wonder if Starky can fiind anything else...
Starky, Hmmmmmm... OOnly junk...
Starky, Woooooow! So this is where it was!

Karsh, The time has finally come... OHHH YEAHHH! Let's get it on!!!
Marcy," Hey, Serge.. C'mon, take me with you. I promise I won't be mean to you, plus I'll beat everyone up!"
Riddel," So this is it... Please call upon me, should you need my assistance."
Viper, The time has come. We must settle this once and for all. I am more than ready.
Nikki, Swing by anytime. I'll play you my coolest ballad next time.
Nikki," What is it, Miki? You don't drop by my room very often."
Nikki, Marcy...
Marcy, Don't try to be buddy-buddy with me!
Nikki, ......
Fargo, Nikki... You've become a fine man...
Nikki, ......
Van," Like you always said, dad... I know it's a cliche, but I guess you can't buy real happiness with money. I don't know if he'll realize that though..."
Van," It's someone that you know well, dad..."
Leena," You never change! You're always like that, aren't you?"
Leena," Ohh, never mind!"
System," ~Beneath the Sacred Sword, ~~~the warriors lie... ~~13th Acacia Dragoon ~~ Grandmaster Garai ~~14th Acacia Dragoon ~~ Grandmaster Dario"
Riddel, Dario...
Glenn, Father... Brother...
Radius, Garai... Forgive me...
Steena," Liberation from the chains of fate... As with humans, the Dragon Gods were also bound by fate. This will be the last battle... The battle between the planet's guardian, the 'Devourer of Time,' and we children of the planet..."
Kid," You're wrong! I'm me! I ain't no Schala's daughter or clone! ...... Yes, that's right Kid! If that's how you feel... I think Princess Schala would have wanted it to be that way too!"
Kid, ......
Kid, ......
Kid," ...... Sis... Well good luck, Kid! Give it your best shot! Show us, the life-forms that exist on this planet, what our new future will be..."
Kid," The final gate, which leads to the darkness of time... Looks like this is finally it... C'MON!"
Norris," Could this be the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time? I guess this is finally it. I have no regrets... I am responsible for my own actions."
Nikki," So this is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time... It's time to settle everything... May the song of truth by the Magical Dreamers be known!"
Viper," Hmph... So this is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time... The time has finally come to settle all scores. Let the honour of the Viper clan shine forth!"
Riddel," So this is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time... It appears that the time has finally come to settle everything. I shall do my best! For the sake of the people I love... Both those I have lost, and those I have gained!"
Karsh," Hah! So this is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time. Looks like the time has come to end this sucker. Watch over us, Dario, as we engage in the battle to end all battles!"
Zoah," THE FINAL GATE, LEADING TO THE DARKNESS OF TIME... THE TIME HAS COME TO END IT ALL. THE QUESTION IS, HOW?"
Marcy," So, like, I guess this is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time! It's time to settle this. I'm not gonna lose! I'm not alone anymore!"
Korcha," So this is the final gate, leadin' to the darkness of time. The time has come to settle everythin' once and for all... Let's do it up! For a brighter future, where humans and demi-humans can coexist in harmony!"
Luccia," I see... So dis is the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time. The time to settle everyt'ing has kom, no...? It vould be most interesting to see vot kind of data I can gat'er here."

Radius," Yes... This must be the final gate, which leads to the darkness of time. The time has come to bring everything to an end. We must find a means without anger or hate."
Fargo," Arg! This looks to be the final gate, leadin' to the darkness of time. Let's finish this off. We've wasted enough bloomin' time as it is!"

Doc," I believe this to be the final gate, leading to the darkness of time, dudes! The time has come. Will the powers of mere mortals prove effective?"
Pierre," Ahhh, oui, oui, oui... This is the final gate to the darkness of time. The time has come for us to settle everything. No enemy can block the way of a true hero!"

Leena, What are you talking about? We just got here. You got some Komodo dragon scales for me... Don't you remember?
Leena," You sound confused... Come on, Serge... Get with the program."
Leena, Our summer's just started...
Peppor, W-Welcome to the 'Development Room!'
Solt, Welcome!
Peppor, Th-This is where the development team gets to shake their thanks? to the players.
Solt," What was that '?' for, Peppor?"
Peppor, ......
Peppor, S-Stop interrupting me. Just shake it and say your line!
Solt," Oh, that was terribly terrible of me!"
Solt, Ahem... Be sure to talk to Peppor or me when you wish to leave.
Peppor," Th-That's the way it goes. You won't be able to shake it outta here otherwise. Well, have a good time!"
Solt, Have a splendidly splendid time!
Peppor, You wanna shake it on out? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Peppor," A-Are you sure? It's 'game over' once you leave. ~~~Yes ~~~Actually, I'll stay"
Peppor, F-Fine. So you're staying.

Peppor, Y-You heard the man. You better be ready! Well then... Good-bye.
Kid, Huh!? What the...!? You have a problem? It ain't like I'm lookin' for someone to pickpocket or lookin' for loose change!

Kid, Hah! Have it yer way. See ya.
Kid, You still wanna continue? ~~~Yes ~~~I'll quit
Kid, Fine. Be my guest.
Leena," Oh, he's back!"
Leena," Hi, honey! How'd it go?"
Man," He almost had one! He hit a 10 foot lion shark, but it got away, just as he was about to hoist it up."
Leena," Ooooh... That's too bad. But I still can't believe you used to be a housekeeper, Serge. You really are something!"
Man," You said it. I've been fishing all my life, and I've yet to come across someone so talented. I sure got myself a great apprentice. I give him a perfect 10!"
Leena," Me, too! A perfect 10!"
Man," There's no doubt, this guy's going to make it big!"
Leena, Oh yeah! A superstar!
Man," He'll be all set to marry you, Leena, and settle down to a sweet, loving family! You go girl!"
Leena," Oh yeah! Go, go!!!"
Leena, ...I mean... Hey!
Man, Hah ha ha! There's nothing to be embarrassed of!
Leena, Oh! Pu-lease!
Kid," ~~~~~See ya, Serge..."
Man," Hm? What is it, Serge? Huh? No, I didn't hear nothin'. You're probably just tired. We had it tough out there."
Leena," That's right. OK, then! Come on, Serge, I'll make you a nice lunch. You have to eat a lot of protein and build up those muscles!"
Man, Oh man... You lovebirds...!
Leena, Come on! Stop teasing me!
Man, Hah ha ha! There's nothing to be embarrassed of!
Kid," I got you now, LYNX!!!"
Kid," Oi! That's the Frozen Flame, ain't it!?"

Karsh, General...
Acacia Dragoon, General! I have important news! The Porre army is heading this way!!!
Acacia Dragoon, HUH!?
Acacia Dragoon, What!?
Zoah, ARGH!!!
Karsh, Fall in line!!!
System," Later... The Acacia Dragoons, led by General Kid... went on to conquer the neighboring countries with ease... It was the birth of a new sovereign nation... The Acacia Empire... And standing next to General Kid's throne... was the Frozen Flame..."
Kid, Why the bloody hell do I have to do this!?
Norris," Stop complaining, 'Bloody Rose.' A spy must conduct field investigations."
Kid, Since when did I become a spy!?
Kid, And quit it with that code name stuff!
Norris, You do not like it? Then how about 'Red Scorpion?'
Kid, That's not the bloody point!
Norris," Yes, sir!"
Kid," Alright, fine... I'll do it. Ya did save me life by getting me the Hydra Humour, I'spose..."
Kid, But none of that code name rubbish!
Kid, Damn! Now where in hell did Serge and them go...?
Leena, Ummm... Excuse me... You have a customer...
Leena," Hmph...! What's so good about Termina anyway...? (I can't believe he decided to work here, even though I found him a job in Arni!!!)"
Leena, OHHH MY!!! I think this Element may be rotten...!? Is this the kind of merchandise you sell to your customers!?
Leena," No, I'm pretty sure the smell is coming from this shop... Coming from your ROTTEN personality!"
Leena, ......!!!
Leena, AHHHHHH...!!! Why does it have to turn out like this!?
Kid, What's eatin' her? That girl needs to take it easy...
Kid," Oi, mate! How's work goin'? I hope you're not cheatin' the shop of all this booty!"
Kid, Hah... I was just kiddin'!
Kid, Let's see here... You got any good Elements?
Kid," You recommend anything, mate!?"
Kid," You really don't talk much, do you? How do you expect to do good business?"
Kid, Listen you...!!! Get off yer high horse! Just because you won the Viper Festival beauty pageant... You only won because this town is filled with a bunch of hags! Just remember that!
Kid, ......!!! (Bugger! How'd she know 'bout that!?)
Kid, AHHH! KORCHA!
Korcha," Don'tCHA worry, Kid. I voted for ya!"
Kid, Sheesh...! I'm honored!
Korcha, Well...ummm... You know... About that agreement we had... Why don'tCHA tell me your answer?
Korcha," ...Y-You don't have to answer immediately, but... How about just gettin' engaged for now, you know...!?"
Korcha," We'll have a blast together! I'll treat ya right! We can go fishin' everyday, and I'll take you anywhere thatCHA wanna go in my boat! We'll settle down in Guldove and raise a happy family! Well?"
Macha," 'Well,' what? Aren'tCHA happy with the way things are, now?"
Korcha, Ma!? WhatCHA doin' here?
Macha," Aren't I allowed to go shoppin'!? From the sounds of it, you just hit puberty!"
Korcha," W-Whatever, ma!"
Solt," Is something wrongly wrong, Monsieur Pierre? This is it! There is no turning back now!"
Peppor, Shake it! Pierre! Solt!
Peppor," J-Just you wait, Lynx! We'll teach you a lesson about General Viper's spice, I mean, spite! Shake it and say your prayers! ...Not that it'll do you any good!"
Solt, Monsieur Pierre! Let us be on our way!
Pierre, Actually... Moi seem to have an upset stomach from last night's party at Monsieur Zappa's. It is not a good idea for moi to run...
Solt, ...Are you seriously serious about being a hero?
Peppor, Th-That's pathetic!!!
Pierre, P-Please! Do not run!!!
Peppor, H-Huh!? What just happened!?
Peppor, W-What are we doin' out here!?
Peppor, W-We're so high up! I-Is this thing floatin'!?
Solt, Our bodies seem to have passed through the floor just now...
Peppor," Th-This sure is some fort... Huh, Pierre? ......!?"
Peppor," W-What's shakin', Pierre? You alright? You don't look so well. W-Who knows if there'll be a toilet up ahead! Shake it and hold it in!"
Pierre, Moi should be fine... Moi am a hero... I-I'll do mon best...
Peppor, W-We shook out a lot of cash to hire you! You better!!!
Peppor, S-Someone shake it and open that door!
Solt," We shall leave this up to you, Peppor!"
Peppor, W-Why me!?
Pierre," Tah ta-tah! Moi say we decide this with a game of rock, paper, scissors. That would be appropriate, non?"
Peppor," G-Good idea! You're a true hero, alright! OK, ready...? Rock, paper, scissor... SHAKE!"
Solt, ......
Solt," It is you, Monsieur Pierre!"
Pierre," Ohhhhhh... Moi feel the squirts coming on...! Oh, the pain... the pain..."
Peppor," ...Ohhh man... Alright, let's shake another game..."
Pierre," Oui, oui, oui!!! Indeed!"
System, The three of them were never heard from again...
Leena," Come on, Lisa! What are you doing!? We won't be able to get good seats if we don't leave now!"
Leena, What!? I don't believe this... Hurry up and find them! We'll be standing all the way in the back at this rate!
Leena, But I never knew she was so talented. Nikki was almost begging her to join.
Leena," My, my... Don't we have an ego..."
Leena," Yeah, come on! We have to hurry!"
Nikki," To all you rockers out there in Termina! Many thanks for coming out to see our gig! I hope you're all having a great time at the Viper Festival! At this time, I'd like to introduce some of our new band members!"
Nikki," On percussion, Serge!!!"
Nikki," And on vocals, we have Kid!!!"
Kid," Oi, everyone! I'm the new vocalist for the Magical Dreamers! Kid's me name! You guys ready to rock!?"
Nikki," Last, but not least, our mascot, Razzly!!!"
Nikki," With our new, powerful line-up, we're gonna rock you out of this world! And now, our opening number...!"

Serge," Well, well, well... If it isn't the 3 old farts... I'll hear what you have to say..."
Radius, Listen well! The countless evil deeds you have commited cannot go unpunished! We can no longer allow you to do as you please! Prepare yourself!
Zappa," Ah hear ye be the bastard that killed all the dragoons dead. That's why ah'm here, to avenge me son!"
Fargo," Arg! I, too, am a villain, but me reasons are just! You're nothin' but a disgrace!"
Serge, Hah. I really don't have time to deal with the likes of you...
Kid, Oi! I ain't gonna let you get in the way of Serge's plan!
Serge," That's the way it goes... But I do need to get used to my new body... I'll make a special exception today, and take you on as well."
Radius," Prepare, scoundrel!"
Kid, Hah! Any time you're ready!
Karsh, Teeeen-huuut!
Karsh," General, the time has finally come for the Acacia Dragoons to sally forth!"
Marcy, Can I kill 'em all yet?
Viper, Hmmm...
Viper," Everyone, prepare yourselves to face Serge's army! Long live the pride and honour of the Acacia Dragoons!!!"
Zoah, ARGH!!!
Norris, It appears this battle is unavoidable...
Norris," I am sure the Porre army will strike back in full force... Perhaps this, too, is fate."
Viper, Move out!!!
Serge, Shall we get started...?
Harle, Monsieur Lynx...
Harle," Zis iz a nice change, non? Just taking it eazy. Before, I would travel all over ze place with2 ze other Monsieur Lynx. I've never stayed in one place for so long."

Kid, I finally found you...
Harle, Ooh lah lah... You are still alive.

Kid," What are you doin' here anyway, Lynx!? This is pathetic! This whole situation is pissin' me off!"
Harle, Zut! Zat crazy blonde iz disturbing us again.
Kid, Shut up! I ain't here to see you!
Kid," Listen up, Lynx! First you take Lucca, and now Serge! It's time for you to pay!"
Kid," Prepare yerself, Lynx! You ain't gettin' away this time! You're goin' down!"
Serge," Hm? Is something wrong, Kid?"
Kid," Yeah... Looks like we've got company. I'll hold 'em off here. You go on ahead, Serge."
Serge," Fine... I'm counting on you, Kid."
Harle, Kid...
Kid, Not you again...! I thought you were with Lynx!?
Harle," You're......I see... I am in a hurry. Would you mind letting me through, pleaze?"
Kid," Hah! It'll take a little more than a 'pleaze' to let you through. Over my dead body, I say!"
Harle," Kid! It iz senseless for us to fight! We must stop Serge... I mean, Monsieur Lynx!"
Kid, Quit tryin' to talk yer way out of it! I don't like you. It's as simple as that! I don't care if it is senseless for us to fight!
Harle, D'accord... Zen I guess it cannot be helped...
Kid," So you're finally ready to face the music, eh!? Put up yer dukes!"
Old Man, Morning! I hope you don't mind. Oh? Are you here to consult the Record of Fate again? You sure are devoted.
Old Man," Heh heh... There's not much else to do at my age... Oh, please... You're still young! Take your time."
Old Man, Let's see now... H-Holy cow...! A-A-Ahhh This can't be...! H-Help!!! What's wrong?
Old Man, Th-The Record of Fate...
Woman, Oh my!
Old Man, I-It's turned black!
Woman," B-But, why!?"
Old Man, How the heck should I know! I-I'll go call the chief. I hope this isn't a bad omen... C-C-CHIEF...!
Serge, Heh heh heh heh... I've finally made it this far...
Serge, And now! The Frozen Flame is finally in my hands!
Serge, I shall become FATE...! Heh heh heh heh... Hah hah hah hah...!
Riddel, Attention!
Riddel," Good morning, everyone. Go~od mo~rni~ng, Miss Riddel!"
Riddel," And now, a word from our headmaster."
Riddel," It's all yours, daddy."
Acacia Dragoon," Are you sure this was what you wanted, sir?"
Dario, Ahahaha! Look! The kids are bursting with joy! It's hard to believe we live in a barbarous world.
Dario, These are the kids that will shape the next generation. I am sure the general is in full agreement.
Dario," Isn't that right, sir?"
Viper," Hmm? Well, ummm... Ahahahahaha!"
Acacia Dragoon," Shall we start a dragoon youth group, sir?"
Dario, Ahahahahaha!
Acacia Dragoon, Ahahahahaha!
Dario," We must keep it a secret from Riddel, though."
Dario, Ahahahahaha!
Acacia Dragoon," What do we do about the operating costs, sir?"
Dario, No need to worry. I have an idea.
Acacia Dragoon," Oh, you mean..."
Dario," We must keep it a secret from Riddel, though."
Dario, Ahahahahaha!
Riddel, Hmm? What is it? What is so amusing?
Dario," Perhaps we can have Riddel work there, too..."
Acacia Dragoon," Are you serious, sir? I'll be a regular for sure!"
Dario, Ahahahahaha!
Serge," Heh... Looks like this place will soon be a ghost town, too... I can't believe it was recently so full of life... Well, I guess I am responsible for all this... Heh heh heh... It's time we wreak some havoc."
Harle, Serge...!
Serge," What is it, Harle...?"
Harle," All zis walking haz made moi fatigée. Pleaze, let'z rest somewhere."
Kid," Yeah, me too."
Serge, Heh... Fine. We're in no hurry. But I wonder if there's somewhere we can rest in this town...?
Harle, I t'ink zat bar may be open.
Serge," Aaaah...yes. It's hard to believe such a place would still be in business during these wretched times. Well, good for us, I suppose. We may also be able to gather some information..."
Serge," Hmmm... Not too bad for a hole in the wall, don't you think?"
Serge, Hey... Can someone see us to a table?
Luccia," Velcome to the Viper bar! Karsh, Marcy, see dat dey get the best table in the house."
Karsh," Right this way, my beautiful ladies..."
Marcy," Hey, good-looking... Why don't you join me here...?"
Karsh, May I take your order?
Serge," An ice-cold beer! On tap, of course!"
Harle," Non, non, non! You are underage! You may be Lynx on ze inside, but you are still a 17 year old boy!"
Kid," Yeah, I guess so... Don't you have any non-alchoholic specials?"
Karsh," Then may I recommend our house special, 'Galaxy Night?' It is a mellow blend of bellflower and soda that is sure to quench the thirst."
Kid," Yeah, I'll have that one."
Harle," I'll have ze 'Denadoro Mountain Blend.' Oh, and make zat two cream, ten sugar."
Serge," Harle... A little heavy on the sugar, aren't you...?"
Harle," It makez moi sweeter for you, mon chéri...!"
Marcy," Hey, handsome... I'd like one of those 'Galaxy Nights,' too... Won't you buy me a drink?"
Serge," Fine, make that one for her and one for me. That'll be all."
Karsh," Excellent choice, sir."
Karsh," 3 orders of our house special, 'Galaxy Night'... and one Denadoro Mountain Blend...two and ten!"
Solt," Yes, sir!!!"
Luccia, Velcome!
Luccia," Peppor, ve have some customers vaiting."
Peppor, I-I'm shakin' it!
Peppor," R-Right this way, please!"
Peppor, M-May I shake your order?
Peppor, B-Box...? L-Liquid...? O-Ohh... So you wanna shake it and try all the drinks we have here? R-Right away!
Serge, Weirdos...
Harle, Who carez about ze ot'er customerz? Let'z have a toast!
Serge, Yeah... I guess so. Well then... To our glory! CHEERS!
Serge, I just wish this boy Serge was of legal drinking age...
Marcy, May I have another...?
Serge, What? You haven't even finished your drink yet...
Marcy," Oh, the ice all melted while we were having that reeeally nice conversation... I want an ice-cold one... Would that be alright...?"
Serge, Fine...fine... Bring out one more Galaxy Night...
Kid, You guys wanna head out soon?
Harle," Oui! Will you be treating us, Serge?"
Serge," Heh... Fine, fine... But just make sure you keep up the good work!"
Harle," Oui, oui! Of course!"
Serge," Alright, you guys wait for me outside."
Serge," Hey, bring me the check!"
Karsh," Thank you very much, sir!"
Luccia, Please pay at the counter.
Karsh," Ladies, I really enjoyed your company today... Please do stop by again. Here is my card."
Serge," Well, how much?"
Luccia, Only dis much...
Serge," Let's see here... Whoa, we drank quite a bit... Huh? Looks like there's an extra 0 on the total there..."
Luccia, No... Dis is the correct amount.
Serge, You gotta be out of your mind! I don't have that kind of cash on me!
Luccia," If you cannot pay, please step inside our consultation room next door."
Serge, You bet I will! You don't know who you're dealing with...!
Serge," Hey, this price is ridiculous! I'll sue you, you know! ......!?"
Zoah, NO... YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEALING WITH.
Karsh, Gah hah hah hah... Easy money...
Marcy, Looks like we'll meet our quota for this month.
Karsh," Yeah... But still, all I wanna know is when we can start wreaking some havoc again! I'm not cut out for this kinda stuff!"
Marcy," So you say, but I know you enjoy being the ladies' man..."
Karsh, W-Whatever!
Harle, How many yearz haz it been since I last vizited...?
Harle, Sigh...
Harle, ......
Harle, ......
Harle, ...... ...Hmmm...
Harle, I wonder if theze flowerz will do...?
Kid, An ancient magical kingdom...? That you destroyed ten thousand years ago...? What are ya talkin' about?
Kid, Stop it... I don't know nothin'! I'm... I'm Kid!! I'm myself and nobody else!!
Norris," If I take this with me back to Porre, there will be even more bloodshed. And yet, it will give us enough power to withstand the other major countries. Is that all I have really desired this whole time...?"
Nikki, Marvelous... It's a truly marvelous tone... It brings out light and darkness within me clearly!
Viper, Hmm... Good Lord! Is there nothing more to life than destroying and defeating one another after all...?
Viper," And only then shall living beings advance forward, to a higher level? The 'survival of the fittest?' Is that the true meaning of evolution?"
Riddel," What an awfully sad light... As long as we are alive, it is impossible to avoid partings. If that is so, then perhaps it would be better if one did not meet others at all... Excuse me? No! It cannot be... Is it you...? It is you! Oh, I am so relieved. You were always by my side, and yet I never noticed..."
Karsh, For crying out loud... Stop it! I know that already! Don't read my mind any further than that!
Zoah," HMPH! WHAT MEANING IS THERE TO A LIFE OF STRIVING AFTER WEALTH AND POWER...? IT IS NO USE TO YOU ONCE YOU DIE! AS FOR ME, I CHOOSE TO LIVE IN BATTLE AND ONE DAY TO DIE IN BATTLE."
Marcy," What? Oh, I already knew that... I know that half of the blood within me is that of a demi-human... And I know that it'll be easier for me if I can accept that fact... What are you, my school counselor or something? Like, tell me something I don't know..."
Korcha, HotCHACHA! This is greatCHA! It feels like firecrackers are going off in my head.
Korcha, I getCHA... I understand it now! All living things are really connected in their hearts! There's nothing to worry about.
Luccia," Ack! Vot power... Dis power is not somet'ing man should possess. yes...it is just as I t'ought. Several civilizations have already been destroyed because of dis immense power... As you said, my friend... Science should only be used for the betterhood of mankind, no!?"
Poshul, Why can't we all be friendth? Ith that tho hard to do?
Poshul," Watch out. Me won't lose againtht any big, bad, ugry enemy!"
Zappa," Aye... These auld bones have seen countless faces of the flame in mah lifetime... But with this un, ah cannae say ah've ever seen more pure and genuine hatred..."
Radius," Ooh... With this power, even an old knight like me could... No! This is the same as what happened before, with the hatred of the Masamune. Oh, Garai...forgive me! I almost made the same grave mistake. What was that...? You say it is behind us now? Is that you, Garai...? Have you forgiven me...?"
Fargo," Ha ha ha!! Arrgh, what are you trying to tell me, Flame? You say that we are all born in sin and all die in sin? Well, I say that is why we should continue to sin, then.... Ha ha ha ha ha! Yet, is not the very reason we go on living so that we can make ammends for our sins!?"
Macha, Why can't we all just be happy for once? If only we could all hold hands and live together in peace and harmony? Why can't people understand this...?
Glenn, You have no right to say such a thing! I am my own person! I will choose my own destiny with my own strength...
Leena, Yes... Yes... I know that what you say may be true.
Leena," But it is because we have such a petty and short life... ...that we all live life to the fullest, for all it's worth! No one, including you -- whoever you are -- has the right to take that away from us..."
Starky, Woowzer! Out of this world...! The liight of the big baang! All starts from heere and all ends heere... What liies beeyond that...?
Van," Mom...!? Is that you I see, Mom!? No, you aren't her! You're just showing me what you think I want to see!"
Sneff," Yes. I know my liffe is ffull off mistakes. But I didn't know back then what I know now, so I have no regrets!"
Steena," This is... divine power! I see... In order to save the many, the few have to be sacrificed... That is the truth...!? It makes us seem oh-so-powerless...! That is the reason why we must live shoulder-to-shoulder and hand-in-hand!"
Doc," Humans are, like, totally powerless, dude! With crafty knowledge we may extend our lives a fraction, but we just extend our suffering, too. But in reality, all we can do is leave ourselves in nature's hands and die the way nature intends us to... That is the awesome truth!? Gnarly!"
Pierre," I understand now! A true hero knows fear... And yet while knowing fear, he still has the courage to put up a fight! If moi lack the caliber to be called such then moi will just have to work harder!"
Norris, You work to be more honest more straight... This world is distorted and crooked. Trying to force your honesty on this crooked world may break you. Beware of that.
Nikki, The reading states that you are a bridge that connects to the other side.
Nikki, A bridge...?
Viper, You will continue to be the rightful lord that you are...
Viper, But I...
Riddel, Deep devotion often makes the impossible possible. I suggest that you keep holding on to your purity.
Riddel, Yes...
Karsh,
Karsh, What the...?
Zoah," I sense deep sadness beneath that mask of yours... In the near future, you, too, shall find your sanctuary of peace..."
Marcy," The reading says, your wish will come true if you purge of your likes and dislikes..."
Korcha," Your fortune reads, that it is a hopeless love... I'm sorry, but you've got to give up."
Korcha, Arrgh!!! Don't give me such boloney!
Luccia, You shall always be under the watchful eye of your former master...
Poshul," Beware of fat and of over-eating... Well, I guess that goes without saying."
Poshul, PO-SHU-SHU!!!
Zappa," You shall encounter the two things you seek... But be careful, for one of them is what you seek only in appearance."
Radius," The many lines laid before you, shall all merge into one..."
Fargo, Take away the mirror of falsity and reflect your image on the mirror of truth. You will then regain your true self.
Macha," It reads that, as a mother, you should set an example for your children."
Glenn," If I were to equate you to something, you would be the moon."
Glenn, Moon...?
Leena," It says, you will not find a boyfriend for a long time. Fortunetelling is such a merciless thing..."
Leena, How rude!
Harle," In your eyes, I perceive... both the look of a beauty and the look of a beast. Be mindful not to bring about your own end. The truth is beginning to reach out to engulf you."
Starky, My word! You are fated to make a grave choice. Whatever will be selected will be decided from the actions of those around you.
Van," Take good care of the ones who love you, my boy."
Van, Humph!
Sneff," You shall once again open your wings in the free world, says the fortune."
Steena," Hmph, it's useless for a spiritualist to have their fortune read."
Doc, Do not linger on your mistakes in the past. Humans must always look to the future...
Pierre, There are such things as major comebacks in this world... It's all about luck and having everything turn around when things are at their worst. You have that potential in you.
System, Received Janice's What'sUpDoc!

System, Serge falls Sound of a gong Whistle The event is temporary until map is final.
System, Member found Item!4)Item!ARTY0% found
Poshul, PO-SHU? Could that be the voice of the evil dwarveth we were warned about?
Glenn, Father...!? But why...?

Glenn, ......
Radius," The sword is a reflection of one's soul. How I pity you... You've done no wrong, either. Press button to quit Press button for next action --------DUMMY END--------"
Harle," Ooh la lah! Zere iz so much havoc going on in zis world, too! Not bad, Serge! You've wiped out ze whole island."
Luccia, No... It cannot be...! Grobyc!?
Member, You know him?
Luccia," yes... He is a Super Mensch on vhom my brother vas vorking on vhile I vas in Porre. I t'ought it vas destroyed when the lab blew up, 3 years ago..."
Luccia, Dat vas not my brother's true intention!
Luccia," You are responsible for dat explosion, are you not!?"
Luccia, Grobyc... You saved us...?
Luccia," But vhy...? Vhy did you kill my brotter, yet save us?"
Luccia, I... see... Dat sounds like something my brotter vould do...
Luccia, I vant you to kom to my lab. I may be able to help you dere.
Karsh, I can't believe they've taken it!
Harle," You boyz are strong to have beaten the Sky Dragon, non?"
Harle, But alas... You cannot gain the  divine protection of the  6 Dragonz in t'at form.
Harle, Hmm. So th1is iz the  Sky Dragon. I feel...un peu nostalgique... Why do I t'ink th1is way...?
Harle, Nobody wantz to know the truth. th1ey only look for a lie to make th1em feel at eaze.
Harle," C'mon Monsieur Serge, pleaze take moi wit' you sometimez, too!"
Kid, That's it!!!
Kid, That's why Lynx stole your form!
Kid, Yeah... ...Along with the Frozen Flame.
Kid, ......
Leena," Sorry, still in the works, probably won't use."
Kid, In the making.
Marcy, Can I kill 'em all yet?
Harle, Se taire! Shut up...!
Harle, Under construction.
Kid, Under construction.
Old Man," Well now... You're in Arni. What brings you here to this quiet, seaside village...? Oh, it's you, Serge. Just don't be goin' near Hydra Marshes to the east if you go outside. Don't want you to run into those evil dwarves and that Hydra, now. Say, why don't you go talk to the village chief before you set out? His house is just past those gates down yonder. By the way, Serge... You'll be turning 17 pretty soon, no? What do you say we men head out to sea and take on a lion shark!? Only when you've defeated a lion shark can you call yourself a true man of the sea! Hehehe...!"
System," ~~~Sure, take it! ~~~No way! ~~~Sell it for 1,000G"
Woman," Why, hello there, Serge! Can I interest you in something? I have some great Elements. Would you like to take a look?"
System," ~~~No, thank you ~~~Show me your Elements ~~~Show me your Weapons/Armor"
Woman, Oh... Oh well... Come again sometime. Sure! Just one second... Thanks. Come again.
Woman," Oh my! If I were 20 years younger, I would have gladly accepted it. You hold onto that, Serge. Save it for someone special."
System,
Woman," Oh, looks like you found it.030 Oh well... Go ahead, take it. It's on me."
Old Man," Yes, I know. I wonder if those outsiders are back digging, now that the rain's let up? They must be conducting some kind of investigation up there in Fossil Valley. I can't comprehend outsiders. Why would they want to dig up a place like that?"
Man," Yo, Serge. What do you think of this sawfish!? Have you ever seen one this size!? Hah! This has got to be from the legendary Dragon King Palace! Wouldn't you agree, Serge? ~~~Hah, you wish! ~~~You're probably right! Yeah... I guess legends are meant to be legends... Yeah, that definitely would've been too good to be true... Oh well! At least I know for sure that this one's a biggie! Live an honest life, and something good is bound to happen. Hahaha! You think so, too!? I knew it! I just knew it! If it really is true... then from here on out, happiness will be rolling into my life! Business will pick up, money will start pouring in... I'll be able to repair my roof, varnish my boat, buy a new sail... Eat as much squid gut pasta as I want up in Termina... Ahhh... Life is good... Yeah, right...! Who am I kidding? That would definitely be too good to be true! But thanks anyway, Serge. Hahaha... Thanks for playing along. Here's a little something for you. Give it to a girl you like."
Old Man," Zzzz... Zzzzzzz...? Ughh...? Oh, it's you, Serge. Beautiful day, huh? You caught me dozin' off there. By the way, Serge? Do you like the sea? ~~~Yes ~~~Not really... Oh, really? Yeah, the sea sure is great. But just remember, Serge, don't take the sea too lightly. Usually, you'll find the sea to be vast, deep... full of strength and energy, yet kind and gentle. But once it becomes angry, it can turn into the most frightening monster you've ever seen, engulfing everything... Close your eyes and prick up your ears. Can you hear the cries of countless men swallowed by the sea? The hidden secret the sea whispers? I recommend you learn to sense the mood of the sea. That's if you don't want to join the fellows already on the bottom. Oh, really... Well, I guess that's fine. You're entitled to your opinion. But listen to me now and believe me later, Serge. Life on this planet was born of the sea and will eventually return to it. Even our blood is mostly sea water. That has been the contract between the sea and all living creatures since ancient times. No one can defy this rule... Everyone will one day return to the sea. Just keep that in the back of your mind. Hey, Serge. I recommend you learn to sense the mood of the sea. One as young as you shouldn't end up on the sea floor. It shouldn't be too long now before my day will come to return to the sea... When that time comes, I would like to drift away humming a quiet tune... I haven't been to Water Dragon Isle in a while. You can catch great fishies over there! But I only go there once in a blue moon. I want to leave them in peace..."
Girl," Hey, Sergey? Wanna hear a secret? It's about Poshul. ~~~Sure, tell me! ~~~Nah, that's OK Ok, but keep it a secret, OK? Ready? Poshul is such a pig when it comes to eating. She'll do anything if she's fed her favorite dish. Very unlady-like, isn't it? Tempted by food... What? What's Poshul's favorite dish? I can't tell you that! It's a secret between us ladies! Fine!"
Poshul," Oh, hi Serge.. Me am a bit busy right now. Have you already met up with Leena? Me think she wath by the pier."
Poshul, Me am a bit busy right now. Maybe next time.
Poshul, Yeth? What ith it?
Girl," It's boring playing alone. Come on, Poshul, let's play!"
Poshul," Me am thorry. Me am a bit busy right now. We'll play later, OK?"
Girl, How boring!
Man," The Record of Fate tells me not to go out to sea today. That's why I'm here for the chief's lecture. Go against the Record of Fate and you'll regret it for sure. Days like this, it's best to take it easy! We should all live in harmony with fate. Is that a Komodo dragon scale? It's really popular among girls these days, isn't it? It means nothing to me, though. The Record of Fate makes no mention of it."
System,
Old Man," Oh, it's you, Serge. I think the chief is outside. He said he was going to teach some self-defense... He may be old, but he still has some fight left in him. You kids better not misbehave, or else the chief will have to crack down on you all."
Old Man," It says, ~~'The ecstasy and anxiety ~~  of the chosen one...' A mega-babe is in love with me, WHEEEE! I'm on cloud nine!!! But I don't wanna get dumped! It tells of how naive the hearts of man are. Only Chief Radius can come up with a golden saying like that!"
Woman," If you want to record what you've done so far, step up to the Record of Fate and open up the Menu. Then select the block you want and follow the directions to save. Easy, isn't it? But you should go look for another one. I'm going to be here for a while. Oh yeah, and if you go out onto the World Map, you can save without the Record of Fate."
Woman," No cutting in line, Serge! Back of the line!"
Man," That's exactly right, Serge. There it is... The Record of Fate. It records everything, good or bad. If you see one of those things outside, don't forget to record everything you've done so far. Think of how terrible it would be if you lost your past. There wouldn't be anything you could do about it."
Man," C'mon, Serge... Stop gettin' in my face."
Girl," If you listen closely, the Record of Fate will tell you lots of things. Like what you should be doing next. And when you can't hear anything anymore... Well... I guess it means you don't have a future... When that happens, you should just go home and go to sleep. There isn't anything you can do to change fate."
Girl," Serge!!! Keep your hands to yourself, PU-LEASE!!!"
Old Man," Humina, humina, humina...! She sure is pretty! What a knockout that dancer Miki is! The port town of Termina has its share of dancers, but no one, I say, NO ONE compares to Miki. But mind you, I've never actually seen Miki dance... Oh...how I would love to see them jiggle... Err, I'm talking about her arms, of course. Whoa...! Serge! Don't tell grandma about this!"
System," ~~~Sure ~~~Uhh... No, thanks..."
System, Nothing there...
System, No answer... It's just a 'barrel'...
System,
Old Man," Hello there, Serge. Word has it that Komodo dragon scales are quite popular among the young 'uns these days. So you're collecting them too, huh? What, to make a silly little necklace? ~~~That's right! ~~~No way! HeeeHeeeHeee! Well said, Serge!!! You truly are a man of the sea! They don't call me the 'Komodo Dragon Expert' for nothing. Let me give you some pointers. Clean out your ears and listen well, Serge. This is truly top secret. My Super-duper Secret #1 ~~~Rock n' roll to ~~~trap the sucker! My Super-duper Secret #2 ~~~Use the lay of the land ~~~and make a surprise attack! My Super-duper Secret #3 ~~~There is always one that ~~~likes to play tag! ~~~Run with all your might! Beware, these dragons are mighty cautious and run at high speeds. You must face them with your wits, courage, and tenacity. Use your lightning start and run like the wind! Whip past it with all your might!!! But I guess there's no point outrunning it... Anyhow, it's all about guts, my boy! So once you catch up to it, you must fight. Kick that little sucker's butt! But don't get your own butt kicked! Hehehehe... That's about all I can teach you about the ways of an expert. Now go, Serge! Go for the gold and bring forth a brighter tomorrow!!! Hehehe... Sorry... Oh, then forget it. You're no fun... Listen Serge, you have to live a little. Some words of advice... Mega-babe chicks, rock-me- to-the-bone music, and slap-me-silly beverages!"
Old Man," What? You want to hear my super-duper secrets again? ~~~Thankfully, no ~~~Unfortunately, yes You don't have to hold back, you know... I'm sure you'll be able to succeed me as a Komodo Dragon Expert! Devotion is the key, Serge. Hmmm... Actually, I really don't have time to be going over this with you... But I guess it is my duty as a Komodo Dragon Expert. Perhaps it's destiny. Clean out your ears even deeper, Serge, and listen carefully. So, Serge... How'd it go? Did my pointers help? What...? Someone gave it to you!? You lily-livered coward!!! A true man uses wits, courage, and tenacity to catch one! Think about it, Serge. What good is something if you didn't work your heart out for it? I guess I overestimated you..."
Porre Soldier, The Porre Army is currently investigating the area. It is off-limits to the general public. We will inform you when our investigation is complete.
Porre Soldier," Beat it, kid. There's nothing to see here."
Man," Why, if it isn't Serge! Didn't the village elders tell you not to come near here!"
Acacia Dragoon, The Acacia Dragoons are currently investigating the area. It is off-limits to the general public. We will inform you when our investigation is complete.
Acacia Dragoon," Beat it, kid. There's nothing to see here."

System, The surface of this slope is too slippery to climb!
Old Man," Well now, you're in Arni. What brings you here to this quiet, seaside village? There isn't much excitement here, but please relax and stay awhile. Are you new to this region? Then I'd advise you to stay away from Hydra Marshes. Ever since the Hydra was wiped out several years ago, the water over there's gone bad. I hear the water's actually poisoned. Better not set foot in there, young man."
System,
Woman," I'm sorry, but that's not for sale. Can I interest you in something else? I said... It's not for sale! Why don't you just buy something else?"
Woman," Hello! Can I interest you in something? I have some great Elements. Would you like to take a look? ~~~No, thank you ~~~Show me your Elements ~~~Show me your Weapons/Armor Oh... Oh well... Come again some time. Sure! Just one second... Thanks. Come again. Oh my! A dragon scale? Sorry. You can't coax me into giving you a discount with that."
Woman, Hello! How can I help you?
Old Man, Looks like it's gonna be another scorcher today. It hasn't rained in quite a while... I don't know how much longer us old-timers can stand this heat...
Man," Arghhhh! I just haven't been able to hit a big one lately, you know? I'm not really concerned about the money or profit. I just have this urge for a challenge... C'mon, baby! I know you're out there! I need some excitement! Give me a big catch! Hey, that's an amulet made from a lion shark tooth. It's huge!"
Girl," The only things the Record of Fate doesn't touch upon are life and death. I don't mind, really... I don't think I really want to know. More importantly, what should I see first at the festival in Termina? Should I go catch Nikki's concert? The mermaid dance show? Hmmm... What to see..."
Girl," EXCUSE YOU! Stop pushing, and keep your hands to yourself!"
Old Man," That's right. The Record of Fate records everything for us, good or bad. So when the time comes for us to bid adieu, our life story will live on in the Record of Fate. Think about how terrible it would be if you left this world with no record of your very existence."
Old Man," Hey man, stop gettin' in my face."

Old Man," This year's Viper Festival is going to be some event! They're going to have a famous minstrel band there. You see that poster over there? He's the lead guitarist and vocalist of the band. He dresses flamboyantly, but he drives the women mad, young and old! He puts on a powerful show, too."
System, No answer... It seems to be just a 'pot'...
System,
System, You felt a beam of light from Lasery the cat!!! ......NOT! You felt an aura of longevity from Aurey the cat!!! ......NOT! You received a sacred lickaroo from Lickey the cat!!! ......NOT! No answer... It seems to be just a straw doll...
System,
Old Man," Zzzz... Zzzz...? Hwaaah...... The tranquil sound of the waves does it to me every time. It makes me so sleepy. I bet the lullaby we heard in our mothers' wombs was kinda like this. One day, we will all return to the Mother Sea... Embraced by her lullaby... In due course, your time will also come to return to the sea, young man..."
Acacia Dragoon," Our excavation is nearly complete. Just stick to the low path and make your way through. We still have some of our men working on the high ground, so do not interfere with their work."
Acacia Dragoon, Watch out for wild monsters running about.
Acacia Dragoon," We are investigating a supernatural phenomenon up there... It is off-limits to the... Hey, are you the exorcists we sent for? ~~~Yes, we are ~~~No, we're not Ohhh, great! I thought you'd be a little older... Please make your way up the rope ladder. Go away. This is off-limits to the general public. Can't you see I'm busy, here? Please make your way up the rope ladder."
Acacia Dragoon," They say there's a ghost in Arni Village, and now this mysterious howling... Why must we conduct such strange investigations...? I just hope it's not some kind of omen..."
Acacia Dragoon," I'm glad that was taken care of. I wonder how Sir Karsh is doing...? ...You know, with the Isle of the Damned incident and all... Uhhh... I-I-It's nothing! I didn't say anything!"
Acacia Dragoon," No one's been down there yet... There might be a monster that'll bite your head off... Why am I in charge here? It's only my first day on the job! !!! HEY! Don't go down there! I'm the one that's gonna get it from the boss if I let anyone down there! Plus, I really think there's a monster down below! I'm warnin' you!!! You had me worried sick! You guys, alright!? You had me worried sick! Hey, you guys are pretty strong... Listen...uhh... Can we make it so that it was me who defeated the monster? Come on, please?"
System,
Acacia Dragoon," Wow! That was quick. I'm glad we called in professionals to get the job done. Actually, there was a man claiming to be a priest who came by earlier. Of course, I sent him back. He was certainly a fake. I can't believe he would try to fool us like that. Anyway, thank you very much for a job well done!"
Acacia Dragoon, Authorization is required to pass through.
Acacia Dragoon," Now, beat it!"
Acacia Dragoon, Identify yourself!
Acacia Dragoon, This is Viper Manor.
Woman," Huh? Who was that? You don't know who he is? Ahaa, you must be one of the tourists here to see the festival. That boy is dear, sweet Glenn, a member of the Acacia Dragoons. Pretty popular with the people here. But it really surprises me to see that naughty little boy grown so mature... It makes me feel my age. Sigh... Ah, it's a bellflower, isn't it? It's a pretty flower, but it has a slightly lonesome feel. Dario loved this flower. He kept his own sadness and sufferings to himself, so I kind of understand why he liked that flower... But where did you get that flower? Dear Glenn will be delighted if you bring that to him."
Old Man," If you folks are looking to get into Master Viper's manor, good luck. The most you will get is a cold reception from the gate guards. Ho ho ho!"
Woman, How's this?
Woman," Just look around. Flowers decorate the town when the festival comes. Don't you think it's romantic to have the whole town filled with flowers? It's our way of showing our gratitude towards Master Viper. We are really thankful to Master Viper for our town's peace... Oh, you silly boy. That's your right, isn't it?"
Woman," When the weather is so nice out, the laundry will dry quickly. It makes me so happy, and the laundry even has a fresh, sun-dried scent too. Then again, if it gets too dry, I'll start worrying about droughts... Sometimes, it's got to rain too. Am I being a bit too selfish?"
Old Man," As you gaze at the sea all day long... One starts to wonder where the sea ends, and where I start... I've tried to live my way, but maybe I have just been drifting along, trapped in the ebb and flow of the ocean's tides... Wouldn't you agree, dear? ? How could I forget... She has already returned to the great sea..."
Man," My, you folks are mighty anxious. Sorry, it'll be just a bit longer. I'll have these hot baked Viper Churros ready in a jiffy! What's that? You don't know what Viper Churros are? First, grind down Heckran bones, add a little water from Water Dragon Isle, then wrap 'em up with Beeba skin. You then add some sugar and spices, get steaming coals from Mount Pyre and bake 'em. For the finishing touch, we even add the famed 'Dragon's Glory!' How 'bout it? Doesn't that tempt your appetite just hearing about it? It's a great day and I've scored a good place to sell. They'll sell like hotcakes today!"
System, You can hear a faint sob...
Man," Sigh...I overslept, and this corner's the only place open... To make things worse, the shrines are just past this point. They're called shrines, but they're really just a bunch of graves. I feel a bit uneasy... It's rumored that a possessed giant and a girl live in the shack near that shrine... Wow, big bro's got a great place to open shop. That spot's ideal for roadside merchants like us. Oops, no time to lose. I gotta hurry and set up myself... Please come back a little later."
System," 'Shrine Area' Those not paying respects, please refrain from entering."
Girl, I'm gonna be Nikki's honeybun! Then I will make lots and lots of mud pies for him to eat!
Man," I should just jump into the river and... Oh, uh, don't get me wrong. Since the weather's so hot, I just thought it might be cool to jump into the river. The dragons up in Mount Pyre must be acting up this year... Huh? You're asking if there's really a dragon there?010 No, no, that's just folk tale. Besides, who wants to climb up that mountain, anyway? Unless you're some kinda crazy climber, that is. It's making me sweat just talking about it. I want to jump into the river when it's this hot out here."
Man," Arrgh, they're not selling at all. A Viper Festival isn't a Viper Festival until ya have Viper Churros, right? This isn't going well. I'm setting a bad example for my little brother... Shoot, do you think 100G is too much for one Churro? ~~~Too much ~~~About right ~~~That's cheap Just as I thought!!! I had a hunch that it was just a tad too much. How much would you charge for it?"
System," You were forced to buy a Viper Churro! Not bad... In fact, you feel revitalized!!!"
Man," ...Oh, you don't even have 100G. I lowered the price, just like you said."
Woman, Shall I draw you a portrait?
Old Man," Sometimes you'll discover some rare stuff at a flea market. Mind you, this is just between you and me. I'm hoping that the Frozen Flame will pop up here. I've got to check everything!"
Girl," That Pierre staying at Zappa's place says he's a 'hero,' but it sounds fishy... In the first place, the way he talks is just too strange! Anyone that believes him is either too honest or gullible... Oh, that John... He's working hard to become a hero, but... I wonder if he'll ever tell me, 'I'll be your hero!' Ahhh..."
Girl," It is just hopeless. Although these two are brothers, they're always fighting over something... Mr. Dario and Mr. Glenn once lived here peacefully. Mr. Dario used to watch over Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Glenn respected his big brother more than anyone else... They were poor but happy, thinking only of each other's well being... You can see that just by looking at this room, right? It is just hopeless. Although these two are brothers, they're always fighting over something..."
System," It's the lucky charm, Lucky the Cat..."
System," You can't say it is a skillful work, but it has a certain beauty."
System, It's full of 'Dragon's Glory'...
Man," Looks like this 'marketing' thing is important, just like my brother said. After lowering the price as you suggested, they started selling like crazy! If you don't mind leftovers, please have some for yourself. You have taken a Viper Churro... Not bad... And it even revitalizes you!"
Acacia Dragoon, The inn is a hot spot for rogues and vagrants. I'm here checking for anyone suspicious.
Man, Would you like to buy a Viper Churro?
Man, Only 100G each!
Acacia Dragoon," I'm looking for a useful Element... Even for dragoons like us who train daily, Element selection is crucial. One selection can either make or break your advantage in battle. That's why it's so hard to choose..."
Man," Sigh...I've been fired from my job, and I'm really strapped for cash... But have you heard about this thing called the 'Frozen Flame'? ~~~Yeah ~~~What's that? Whaaat? That thing is gonna be mine! Once you get your hands on it, you're guaranteed to be El Nido's, no, the world's richest man! That's what I call a 'Terminian Dream!!!' What else can you call it? Alright! One more toast to my bright future! What, you haven't heard? Oh well, I was gonna keep it a secret, but I'll make an exception for you! The 'Frozen Flame' is the treasure of treasures! It's the ultimate treasure in this world! It's rumored that the notorious thieves Radical Dreamers are also after it, but... That thing is MINE! One day, I'll get my hands on it and become the richest man in the universe! That's my 'Terminian Dream!!!' Alright! One more toast to my bright future!"
Man," This guy thinks that the 'Frozen Flame' is some kind of jewel or something. I'd say things aren't that easy. It's probably a monster of some sort. Once you gaze at it, BOOM! You're well-done, like a steak on a barbecue. Well, you're free to dream, but daily work is always the best. Nothing beats hard work and dedication!!!"
Man," Ever since Dario died, one of the chairs for the 4 Devas of the Acacia Dragoons is vacant. Sir Viper is said to be looking for candidates... Yet, I can't foresee anyone who can match the caliber of the great knight Dario. If only I were a little younger..."
Woman," I saw Miss Riddel visiting the shrines again. She made a darling couple with her childhood sweetheart, Dario. It's such a pity that he died so young... They say beautiful women rarely find happiness... How about me? Do I look happy? ~~~You look happy ~~~You look unhappy So you mean I'm not beautiful then...!? Oh my, do I...? Why, thank you, although I know it's just flattery!"
Man, Barkeep! One more order of squid gut pasta!!!
Man," Hehehe!!! The better tasting it is, the faster I eat it up!"
System, It's locked...
System, There's an old notebook. ~~~Read it ~~~Don't read it
System, There are red berries growing. There are blue berries growing. There are green berries growing.
System, It won't budge. Looks like you can push it.
Acacia Dragoon," Yo, man... Did you check out the general's guest?"
Acacia Dragoon, Yeah... What a freak...
Acacia Dragoon, A He-Beast...?
Acacia Dragoon," Ah, whatever. Just don't get involved."
Acacia Dragoon, Yeah...
Acacia Dragoon, I don't wanna talk about it anymore...
Acacia Dragoon," Intruders!!! Damn, they got away."
Acacia Dragoon," Stop, right there!!! Huh? Where did they go?"
Acacia Dragoon, INTRUDERS!!! Arghhhh!!! Over here!!!
System, There's something blocking the way.
System, There's something up front.
System, There's a knob with numbers. ~~~Turn it ~~~Forget it
Acacia Dragoon, HEY! You...! That's...
System, It's locked from the inside.
Acacia Dragoon," You need permission to enter. Now, get back to your post."
Acacia Dragoon," I'm not slacking off! I have the parlor key with me, but... I think I better hide it so I don't lose it."
Acacia Dragoon," This is the treasure vault. You must have special permission to enter. What's with you guys!? Say the password! Alright, one more time. What's the password!? ~~~I don't know! ~~~Long live General Viper! ~~~Karsh rules! ~~~Dragoons forever! WHAT!? NEGATIVE! Correct. The password is silence. You may enter. You're imposters! Oh, you're not? Leave immediately after you're done. Don't touch anything."
System, The vase is actually a monster!
System, There's a shield. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone There's armor. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone There's a sword. ~~~Take it ~~~Leave it alone
System, It's locked.
Acacia Dragoon, Watch out for traps. Don't touch anything.
System, A suit of armor missing a shield.
System," A decor shield. ~~~Take it ~~~No, too dangerous..."
System, The shield has been set.
System, A statue of a snake.
System, Looks like you can push it. It's set.
System, It's secured.
System, It won't move.
System, -10
Acacia Dragoon, It's no use. You need to bring the general here to get to it.
Acacia Dragoon," The code for the trap door changes every week, you know. Random numbers won't work. And don't walk in the middle of the hallways! Got that?"
Acacia Dragoon," Ever since the general's guest showed up, monsters have been popping up inside the manor. I don't want to dishonor the general's guest, but I have a bad feeling about him. You know the monsters that peep through the doors...? You can get by them when they shut their eyes."
Acacia Dragoon, An envoy from Porre is here about the Frozen Flame. But I get the feeling he already knows about it. My gut instinct tells me there may be a Porre spy inside Viper Manor.
Acacia Dragoon, What the hell's taking so long? Where's my food already...?
System, Nothing...
System, There's a message on the wall.
Acacia Dragoon," Looks like Glenn set off the trap again. He's still an apprentice dragoon, you know? I can understand the pressure he feels, though, having a brother who was one of the 4 Devas..."
Acacia Dragoon," Hey, do you guys have the flu or something? Must be hard to walk around, huh? Here, take this Medicine and call me in the morning."
Acacia Dragoon," There's going to be a grand expedition sometime soon. Most of the dragoons will be setting out. But, then, I wonder who's going to defend our manor? I just hope the Porre military from the mainland doesn't invade this place."
Acacia Dragoon," That Glenn over there is the younger brother of Dario, one of the 4 Dragoon Devas."
Acacia Dragoon," Have you seen the machinery outside? Miss Luccia has taken broken parts from Fort Dragonia and is using them to remodel that thing. Those parts are actually weaponry from an ancient, lost supercivilization. She's quite the genius to be able to work with them."
Acacia Dragoon," It's been 3 years since Sir Dario's death... Miss Riddel has been heavy-hearted since, and it feels as though all the life went out in this manor. General Viper doesn't show it, but I'm sure he, too, is suffering inside."
Acacia Dragoon, Zzzz... Zzzz...
Acacia Dragoon," All he does is sleep. Always mumbling and dreaming away... He says he's someone else in his dream, and that he's living a different life."
System, It's locked.
System, There's a switch. ~~~Push it ~~~Don't push it
System, There's a switch. ~~~Push it ~~~Don't push it
System, A switch on the armrest... ~~~Push it ~~~Don't push it
System, It's locked from the inside.
System, There's some kind of device.
Girl," Welcome traveler! I will trade you materials for your extra Elements here. ~~~Trade ~~~Thanks, maybe later ...Oh, that's too bad. We have many kinds of materials you might be interested in. Thank you so much! If you find more unwanted Elements, please come again!"
Man," My partner's a demi-human, but he's got no energy. Geez, he's worthless."
Man, The population is lower compared to the past... Old customs and lores might fade away with time...
System, Let's not go in right now.
Girl, This is the residential tower.
Woman," To the north of this village lies Earth Dragon Isle, which we locals call 'The Land Where the Dragon Sleeps.' Until a few years ago, the surface was covered with sand, but somehow, the sand disappeared completely overnight. From what I've heard from another traveler, the once plentiful water on Water Dragon Isle has completely dried up due to abnormal weather..."
System, You paid 5G.
System, You paid 10G.
Girl," Say, have you ever heard of the 6 Dragons? In this world, there's supposedly 6 Dragon Gods somewhere out there. 'The 6 Great Dragons descend from the heavens to seal away the evil and promise eternal prosperity across the land...' This is part of an old song that's been passed down in El Nido for a long time. I wonder what they look like?"
Girl," Yes? Do you want to become the wind? ~~~Not now ~~~Become the wind Ah, shucks. Call me when you do, though. What a letdown. It'll be 5G in advance. ~~~Pay 5G ~~~No thanks"
System, You paid 5G.
Girl," Hehe, thanks! OK...ready. Have a safe flight! Hey, wait a minute. You don't even have 5G? Whoa...that's sad."
Man," This is the Dragon Shrine, residence of our chief, Shaman Direa. Be sure to act courteously on the premises. Travelers, if you seek guidance from the Records of Fate, you may enter this tower."
Man," As a man of the sea, you gotta be on your toes whether you're on land or manning the ship! I always pay close attention to my Element placement! You have to think about terrain and attribute conditions, so it's pretty complicated."
Woman," For crying out loud, how many times do I have to tell you not to come behind the count... Hey, you're an unfamiliar face. But you're just a customer as well, so out you go. You're in my way."
System,
Man," It hasn't rained around here for the longest time. The traders say the water on Water Dragon Isle has dried up, too..."
Man," We don't get much news of the main island out here. Judging from the season, I guess it's about time the El Nido Festival starts."
Woman, Glenn is always like that when I bring up something about his big brother. His brother being such a brilliant man must be hard on him.
Woman," Unfortunately, Nikki's concert has been canceled because of the going-ons at Viper Manor... Just when I was getting ready to show off my moves to Nikki's rad tunes..."
Woman," A thief snuck into Viper Manor? My, my, there are some bad people in this world. I hope dear Glenn and all are OK..."
Woman," Do you know if the Radical Dreamers steal laundry too? I'm so worried, I have to stay here and watch'em until they're dry."
Man," Ohh, Master Viper... I have been polishing this statue and waiting for your arrival, but your visit to Termina has been delayed... Was there not enough effort in the polish that these old bones finished? Alrighty then! This calls for another round of waxing!!!"
Woman," Did you hear? That infamous band of thieves, Radical Dreamers, raided Lord Viper's manor! It's become so vicious around here. If only we had peace, I couldn't wish for anything more."
Woman, Sob...sob... Why did such a sweet child have to...
Man, Sob...sob... I-I can't believe...
Man," Wow, big bro's got a great place to open shop. That spot's ideal for roadside merchants like us. Oops, no time to lose. I gotta hurry and set up myself... Please come back a little later."
Man," I heard the Radical Dreamers broke into Viper Manor to search for the 'Frozen Flame.' Ha, I don't know what they were thinking. Even Master Viper wouldn't have such a valuable treasure."
Woman," The thieves that broke into Viper Manor took Miss Riddel hostage and ran away with the treasure! Luckily, Miss Riddel was all right, but the dragoons are still looking for the thieves."
Man," Did you hear? There's a rumor that Karsh plotted Dario's death! I know it sounds odd, but the two were longtime rivals. Also, Karsh was the only one there when Dario died. I guess we'll never know the truth, but Karsh is the number one suspect if you ask me."
Girl," Mama... She's asleep. Mama's busy working all by herself day after day. No wonder she's so tired. I'm not supposed to know this, but Papa is not really coming back. Mama said he's gone on a long trip on his ship, but... If I weren't so sick, I would've gone out to search for him. But Korcha will find papa for me. On that beautiful boat, right? Korcha is so admirable. He never complains to anyone that he doesn't have a father. Mama will understand some day that Korcha is such a nice person... What is it...? Someone always brings Drakehorn grass and leaves it here for us... If you drink soup made from it, it will stop any bad cough almost instantly. I'm glad to have it, but who could be leaving it for us?"
Girl," Rats, so I can't meet Nikki here? Then I'm not gonna be his honeybun!"
System, Go down the bluffs? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System,
System, The device is inactive.
Acacia Dragoon," Huh? Where is everybody...? Aaah, forget it... Zzzz... Zzzz..."
Acacia Dragoon, I'll wait 'til hell freezes over...!
System, It won't open! There must be a way...
System, You found a door that leads down. ~~~Go down ~~~Stay
System, Member found Life Sparkle!
System,
Man," The dwarves who live in these woods detest humans. They may be small, but they make up for it by working in numbers! Don't go trying any 'Dwarf Tossing' now, you hear!? Aha... So you noticed. That's a rare plant you'll only find growing in Hydra Marshes. If you touch it and talk to it, it bends backwards for a little while to form a bridge. I think the dwarves may have planted those. See how they're strategically placed? I believe there's another way to bend them without actually having to touch them... I don't know the details, though. The dwarves dwelling in this forest would probably know, but they hate humans. They wouldn't tell us... Hey, you don't look so well. Don't tell me you touched one of those Potpourris? They won't hurt you if you leave 'em alone. ...Ahh, oh well... Anyway, come here, and I'll give you an Antidote to remove that poison. Just watch it next time. There, you're all set. But your HP hasn't been restored. You should probably head on home and get some rest."
System,
System, Jump down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Man," All of a sudden, the aura about this forest seems different... I can't really pinpoint what, though... I don't think we should stay here much longer. I sense bad vibes in the air, plus the forest seems a lot noisier."
System, The surface of this slope is too slippery to climb!
Woman, Hello! How can I help you? I got in some new weapons and armor.
Man," I don't know what's going on, but Mel hasn't come by this tower today. Have you tried the residential tower?"
Woman, I'm going to feel insecure without the Acacia Dragoons protecting the town. This town is peaceful only because the Dragoon Knights guard us.
Girl, Looks like... I said something terrible to them. But those are my true feelings I didn't lie...
System," Board the boat? ~~~OK, let's go! ~~~No, wait a minute"
Man," Those who die at sea with strong attachments to life are said to become wandering spirits for eternity... A monster lives in the sea by consuming these lost spirits. It envies the living and tries to make you into one of its kind. Danger is inseparable from travel... Be extra-cautious about the 'mist on the sea,' young travelers. We humans are inisignificant when out on the great seas."
Girl," Um, would you like to become the wind? ~~~I won't become the wind ~~~I will become the wind Oh...that's too bad. Um, for a lecture on this, see my big brother. He's at the residential tower. Please come back when you're done. Then, it will be 2G in advance. ~~~Pay 2G ~~~Maybe next time. You paid 2G. Heh heh, thank you, sir. Well, please become the wind. A-one and a-two... OK, standby. ...... Not enough money. Oh, you're quitting!? Too bad..."
System, Go down into the sand boil? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System," This must be the sand boil the explorers were talking about. It's not functioning, though."
System, The ground here is hot... Vegetation won't be able to grow here...
Woman, Skelly has a somewhat 'unique' appearance. But I'm so glad that he has come back! I've never seen grandma so happy!
System, ...You can't enter Fairy-ville right now.
Old Man," Many say it's better for people to stay away from that island. But I guess what has to be done, MUST be done... So what is it? Did you forget your spare bandana there or something? Well? I'll take you there for 100G. What do want to do?"
Old Man," I'll be here waiting, so run along and hurry back."
System, The ground has cooled down. Vegetation can grow here again.
System, ~~~Go up ~~~Go down ~~~Stay
System, It's some kind of device. It's not functioning... It's some kind of device. There's a broken egg shell inside... ~~~Go up ~~~Stay
System, It's locked from the inside... It's locked... Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System, There's an empty cage here. Looks like it was used to trap something...
Porre Soldier, ......!? W-Who the...!? The Porre Army is currently investigating the area. It is off-limits to the general public. Our investigation should be completed soon. P-Please don't scratch my eyes out!
Porre Soldier, A-Ahhh!!! O-Our investigation should be over soon. P-Please don't stare me down like that!
Porre Soldier, Th-There he is again! Why does he look like that!? What is he!?
System,
Old Man, I have nothing to say to you demi-humans! Now git the hell outta our village! Accursed monsters!
Woman," Oh my... What parts do you hail from? Well, it doesn't much matter to me. Customers are my business! How can I help you? ~~~No, thank you ~~~Show me your Elements ~~~Show me your Weapons/Armor I don't like window-shoppers. Would you stop loitering!? You're hurting my business! Alrighty! Just a minute, please! Thanks. Come again."
Old Man," Well, hello there...... Huh? Who are you folks...? Demi-humans, eh? Just don't cause any trouble in our village, OK?"
Man," AHHH...!? W-W-Who are you!? What do you want!? Ohh... I know... You're after my sawfish, aren't you? Am I right? Well, I got no fishes for a stray cat like you! Now, scram! Shoo-shoo! Hey, that's an amulet made from a lion shark tooth. It's huge! Wait a minute... Isn't this Kiki's dad's? What are you doing with it?"
Girl," You sure do dress funny, mister. You look like a cute kitty-cat!!!"
Man," Hmmm.... The Record of Fate makes no mention of me meeting a demi-human... No, no, you must be mistaken. The Record of Fate never makes mistakes."
Old Man," Huaaaaaah... What? I don't have any business with you demi-humans. If I let you on my boat, I might end up waking up the dead! I'm very superstitious you know. How do you think I lived to be this old?"
Man," Well, well, this is unusual. What business does a demi-human like you have with the chief? The chief isn't here. He said he was going out for a stroll. It says, ~~'The ecstasy and anxiety ~~  of the chosen one...' It appears fate has chosen you to face a great test, too. One of joy, anguish and... You will face great hardship, but it is unavoidable. No one can do this but you..."
Woman," You're not from this village, are you? But then again, you're not even human! You have some nerve trying to use our Record of Fate! Go somewhere else!"
Old Man, Yowzer! I thought you were Serge!
Old Man," Hmmm... The demi-human, Lynx? I may have heard something about him when I was in Termina... I don't recall the details, but I believe he was a good friend of General Viper... Don't tell me you're..."
Man," Yo, demi-human. Have you heard anything about them group of thieves up on the mainland? If you ask me, you guys look a lot more menacing than those Radical Dreamers I've been hearin' about. Hey, man, I'm just kidding! They say cats have 9 lives, but watch it there, fella. The village folk have a short temper."
Old Man," Oh, a feline demi-human. I've never seen anything like you... Are you from the Zenan continent? I've heard about a man named Lynx who used to visit General Viper up in Termina... Could you be him?"
Man," Chief Radius, please be careful. We shall follow the Record of Fate and do our best!"
Girl," Hi, Chief! Come back soon for story time, OK?"
Old Man," Hello, Chief. Looks like the time has finally come to face your past. Please be careful. Everyone in the village will pray for your safe return."
Girl," Chief Radius, will you be leaving us? Please take care of yourself. We will all pray for your safe return."
Woman," Oh, Chief. Is it true that you're leaving the village for a while? Don't worry, I'll take care of the Record of Fate."
Girl," Chief, does the Record of Fate speak of anything? What kind of future is in store for us?"
Man," Have you been keeping up with the Record of Fate, Chief? Well, of course you have. You're the chief."
Porre Soldier, I have orders not to let anyone through until Commander Norris arrives.
Porre Soldier, The Porre Army is currently investigating. This area is off-limits until things clear up.
Porre Soldier, This area is under Porre military control. No admittance until the investigation is over.
Porre Soldier, I'm on patrol duty. Don't bother me.
Porre Soldier, Commander Norris is at the ruins of Viper Manor. Please report your current status immediately!
Man," Argh, it's such a pity... The statue of Master Viper that I've polished everyday has been changed to this... The once magnificent manor is also long gone. If only Master Viper were here, none of this would've happened... !!! I-If it isn't Sir Lynx!! I-It's a great relief that you're safe..."
Porre Soldier," This is the Porre Army's state-of-the-art weaponry. As long as we have this, the citizens of Termina wouldn't dare revolt against us."
Porre Soldier," We will open fire on any suspicious ship, if they do not respond to our call. When you travel by ship, I advise you to be careful."
Porre Soldier, Inform me immediately if you find anything.
Girl," Oh that Paul. He's working hard to join the Black Wind of Porre, but... I wonder if he'll ever tell me, 'I'll be your wind!' Sigh..."
System," There's a turtle here... It's the lucky charm, Lucky the Cat..."
Porre Soldier," From what I've heard, this shack is where Dario and his brother Glenn lived in. Some people claim to have seen him, so we're currently looking for this 'Dario,' but... Just when we thought the Acacia Dragoons were gone, this troublemaker decides to come back... If you find any information about him, let us know."
Porre Soldier," This Dario person seems to have been an exceptionally dignified man. If he's still alive, we should enlist him into the 'Black Wind'..."
Porre Soldier," I checked the sword in the ground over there, but it was just a rusted sword... It's probably called a 'Sacred Sword' in honor of a lost member..."
Woman, Grandma's been worried sick ever since the Porre Army took her grandson away. She loved him so much... I just hope he's alright...
Man," S-Sir Lynx!? You're still alive, sir...? Th-There's nothing here in this old shack, but... W-Would you like some tea or something?"
Girl," Get out, you big, stray cat! I don't like you!!!"
Man," N-Now, there! Stop that! Girl Father's the one who is always saying it!!! If this guy never came here, we wouldn't be in this mess!!!"
Man," ~!!!~ No, no, Sir Lynx. Umm, well... You see, it's just kid's talk! There's this stray cat that steals our fish around here so... Umm, haha... It's really a nuisance... Come on, now. You apologize, too!!!"
Girl, Hehehe... We're really sorry.
Man, I'm really sorry...
Girl, ......
Porre Soldier," Even though I'm here relaxing, I can't shake away this mystery from my mind... Will you listen to my story? ~~~Sure ~~~No, not now It happened about 3 years ago... General Viper and his men disappeared from the manor. We searched the manor for them, but found no traces. I can only guess that they were spirited away. What in the world could have happened... To think that the same thing could happen to me someday... I just can't help being afraid, even when I'm trying not to think about it... Too bad... Then I will keep this story to myself..."
System, It's locked...
Porre Soldier, Sir Norris has arrived. Please come in.
Porre Soldier," Sir Norris is in the basement, sir."
Porre Soldier, Sir Norris is in the basement. Please enter through this well.
Porre Soldier, It is unstable here. Please enter through the well on your right to reach the basement.
Porre Soldier, We sent some men to the El Nido Triangle to investigate a mysterious beam of light. And I hear there's a monster atop Sky Dragon Isle! What is up with this El Nido place!?
System, Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Porre Soldier, Sir Norris is in the basement. Please enter through here.
Porre Soldier, Please enter through here to get to the basement of Viper Manor.
Porre Soldier," The ladder leading to the prison is up ahead, sir."
Porre Soldier," Sir! Sir Norris is up this ladder, sir!"
System, Looks like you can push it.
System, It's locked.
Porre Soldier," Nothing unusual, sir!"
Porre Soldier," This is our prize, our latest new weapon. As long as we have this, the citizens of Termina wouldn't dare rebel against us."
Porre Soldier," Sir Norris, please be very careful when you are heading for the high seas!"
Porre Soldier," Nothing unusual, sir."
Porre Soldier," Everything under control, sir!"
Norris," That is correct. As long as you can stand behind what you believe in, then certainly! OK, got it! I'll work even harder!!!"
Porre Soldier," Sir Norris! All is well, sir! I'm on lookout duty, watching for suspicious ships. Don't bother me."
System," Board the boat? ~~~OK, let's go! ~~~Wait a minute"
Porre Soldier," Commander Norris, would you care to join us? Oh, we're not forcing you, anyway. Even though I'm here relaxing, there's this mystery that I can't shake from my mind... Will you listen to my story? ~~~Fine, let's hear it ~~~No, not now As you already know, Commander Norris, it's already been three years... 3 years since General Viper and his men disappeared from the manor. We found no traces of them, even after a thorough investigation. I can only guess that they were spirited away. What in the world could have happened...? To think that the same thing could happen to me someday... I just can't help being afraid, even when I try not to think about it... I understand... Then I will keep this to myself."
Porre Soldier, We have found an entrance to the basement here.
System, Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Porre Soldier," I sense no more glory. It was glory brought on by Porre, anyway."
Porre Soldier, Some of our men investigating the El Nido Triangle have not returned. Would you mind checking up on them if you are in the area?
Porre Soldier," We are still investigating, but we have yet to find any clues to the whereabouts of General Viper and his men."
Porre Soldier, This area is currently under investigation. We still do not know what caused the manor to collapse.
System, There seems to be some trick to opening it.
System," There's a valve. ~~~Tighten it ~~~Open it ~~~Leave it alone It won't tighten anymore. It won't open any further. There seems to be some trick to opening it. 'Water Gate' ~~~Read instructions ~~~Look at Water Gate ~~~Quit The valve is connected to the water gate. Open the valve to open the gate, and tighten it to close the gate."
Porre Soldier," Hey!? Where did the treasure chest go? Damn... So close, yet so far..."
Porre Soldier, It seems to be completely blocked off from here.
Man," Ever since the merchant ships arrived, my shop is being put out of business! Why are outsiders so cold against us demi-humans? But in terms of passion for work, I won't lose to anyone! ~~~That's the spirit! Request upgrade ~~~I'm OK for now Thanks a lot! You've given me some confidence to go on. I'll do my best! In times like these, I suggest that you upgrade your equipment frequently. You never know what's waiting out there."
Woman," This place has been getting a lot of visitors lately... I don't know if that's beneficial for this village, though. Oh, if you have any elements you don't need, I'll trade you for materials. ~~~Sure ~~~No thanks, not now You have a pretty good collection. Still, you'd be better off just trading the unneeded ones rather than keeping them. Oh well, that's fine with me. But having a lot of Elements does you no good if you don't use them."
Woman," Oh, what's this? Did you come from the mainland as well? I've got nothing to sell to my business rivals. See ya. What a strange village this is. To have humans peacefully living together with demi-humans... On top of that, demi-humans even run their own shops... It just annoys me. ......! That includes you too! You're bad for business, so get lost."
Man," Phew, I'm all worn out. Gawd, he works like a madman. How can he keep it up? Doesn't he ever rest?"
System, Board your boat? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Man," You, halt. Judging by your appearance... you are foreign-born? For reasons we will not explain, foreigners are not allowed to enter the tower. Please leave the premises at once."
System, Impossible for a human to pull out...
System, Go in? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System, It's locked.
Man, Ahhh... What a life... I have absolutely nothing to do... Do you envy me? ~~~Yes ~~~You're a loser Hah haha! Sucks to be you! Hah haha! You're just jealous!
Woman," I can't wait to see Nikki's concert! That ship you're looking at belongs to Nikki! He tours the world on that ship. Ohh...Nikki, take me with you!!! OH MY GAWD!!! NIKKI!!!!!!"
Man, She brings me a cocktail when I'm thirsty... Gives me a massage when I'm tense... Now this is what being on a cruise ship is all about!
Man," Have you guys been to an island called Marbule? It used to be a beautiful island where mermaids lived. But now, it's infested by nasty-lookin' monsters. That's where all the demi-human workers on this ship are from. Hey, come on! Don't look at me like that! The demi-humans say they're happy to just have jobs and receive food for wages."
Man," Yes! Stop! Oh man... Every time I'm up, I lose... Greed will do it to ya..."
Man," Even if there's a 99% chance that you'll lose, you gotta bet on that 1%... The lower the odds of winning, the greater the excitement when you win. That's what gambling is all about!"
Man," C'mon, baby! Damn, lost again."
Man," I'm very sorry, but I'm forbidden to talk to passengers..."
Man," Tch! Nikki this and Nikki that! That's all I hear on this ship! What's the big deal anyway!? Look at the way he dresses... And he wears makeup, too! A man has to be tough! Be a man, I say!"
Woman," Oh...Nikki... Just looking at your poster makes my head spin... If I see you in person, I will probably faint... If that should happen, please, Nikki...! Squeeze me in your arms!"
Woman, I wish Nikki's concert would start soon... It took me 6 months to save enough money for this event. I had to sacrifice my daily coffee breaks. But it'll be all worth it when I see Nikki in person!
Solt, What is wrongly wrong with this cat?
Peppor, What's shakin' with this cat?
Peppor, H-He shook what he deserved.
Solt, Old man Sneff would always mockingly mock our comedy act! That is why something awfully awful happened to him!
Peppor, Th-This time I get the punch line!
Solt," This time, I get to say the punch line! Hiya! That hurts! You're misunderstandin' 'punch' line!"
Man," Tough break, man... He couldn't change you back, huh? I told you to watch out for that man!"
Woman, Oh no! He couldn't change you back? Don't worry. I'm sure there's some kind of trick behind it...
Woman," Oh, what a cute little kitty-cat... Sigh... If I were a kitty-cat, I would sneak into Nikki's room and curl up on his lap..."
Man, Huh!? I got nothin' to feed to you felines!
Man, Zzzz... Zzzz...
Woman," If only I were a cat, I'd be able to walk across that rope into Nikki's room... But not with my weight..."
Woman, Yeah! Finish him!!!
Man," Nooo! C'mon, what are you doin'!? I have everything riding on you!!!"
Man, Why does my monster always lose? Am I not feeding it right? Not enough tender loving care...?
Woman, Ooooh... I can't get enough of those ferocious claws... The cry of victory makes me tingle!
Man," OHHH YEAHHH! Give it to me, baby! U-hah, u-hah!!!"
Man, Right on! Jab! Hook! Punch!!! You can do it!!!
Man, They're all taking refuge at the village chief's. I've been told not to let outsiders through. It'd be the end of us if one of Serge's minions were to make its way in.
Porre Soldier, I have orders not to let anyone through.
Porre Soldier, This manor is now occupied by the Porre military.
System, It appears to have been made to hold something. It seems that you cannot do it yet.
Porre Soldier," Commander Norris, thank you for your trouble, sir. Everything is under control, sir. Hey, don't wander around here. You are interfering with my duties."
Porre Soldier," Why Commander Norris. Thank you for your trouble. Currently, we have suspended all economic activities in Termina. We have left only the Element Shop alone, but that smith is a stubborn one... He will not close shop for anything. Of course, the bar over there has been shut down as well. We're pretty thorough when we need to be, you know. Not that anyone would want to go drinking in a time like this, but just in case."
Porre Soldier," Commander Norris, all is well, sir! Don't bother me."
Man," Sir Lynx! Please stop that kid Serge! He looks like this! We're counting on you, sir!"
Man," Arrgh, shoot! I gotta close shop before I've even sold anything!? What rotten luck! Just when I thought business was coming along... The Porre guys storm in, a kid named Serge attacks... it's a mess!"
Woman," Don't bother me, alright? Gotta hurry and clean up! I've got no time to waste around here!"
Man," Just when I got all setup, I had to close up shop. Gosh, what's going on around here?"
Porre Soldier," There are no suspicious ships, sir! I'm on watch for any suspicious ships."
Girl, John... You are the most wonderful hero...
Porre Soldier, These demi-humans are good workers. They really impressed me. Don't you be wandering around here.
Porre Soldier," No suspicious ships to report, sir! Don't bother me."
Porre Soldier," All is well, sir. Too bad we couldn't see the famed Viper Festival. No trespassing."
Porre Soldier, The inn gets many visitors coming into town. We are here checking for anyone suspicious.
Girl, Kein! What are you doing here?
Girl, Were you the one who brought me the Drakehorn grass...?
Girl, But why...?
Girl," Kein... Thank you. But even if I get well, I don't know if we'll ever play outside with the Porre soldiers out there."
Girl," OK! I'll practice my jump rope, too!"
Girl, Uh-huh!
Porre Soldier, The place was deserted by the time we arrived.
Porre Soldier, General Viper and the 4 Devas have gone to Fort Dragonia. I have no further information.
Porre Soldier, I kept the old dragon stable keeper to look after the dragons.
Porre Soldier," I chased off the remaining dragoons, but some were imprisoned."
System, Go down? ~~~Yes ~~~No
Porre Soldier," That over there is our ultimate weapon, Guillot. There's NO WAY you can defeat that thing."
Porre Soldier, Looks like the Viper Manor gang left in fear of our men.
Porre Soldier," I came here looking for a fight, but with no one here, what's the point?"
Porre Soldier, I reckon there's a secret room around here somewhere... Whoa! So that's how you open it.
System, There's a note inside the drawer. ~~~Read it ~~~Don't read it Fear the one with the Missing shield... Repress the anger Of thy god... The moment you see truth From within the light... The god's anger will calm... There's something written on the back. Check the pillar in the armory!!!
Porre Soldier, A living flower... I hope it's not carnivorous. This flower... Seems to be a living creature... The flower... I-It's alive...! Hey? Where did that flower go?
Porre Soldier," It's been 100 years since people first inhabited El Nido... A lot has changed, but the sea remains the same."
Porre Soldier, Commander Norris had another disagreement with his superiors and has been sent to the parlor on the other side.
Porre Soldier, Nice and firm... But a bit smelly...
Porre Soldier," I was convinced the Frozen Flame would be here, but I was wrong."
Porre Soldier, Commander Norris disguised himself as a dishwasher to conduct espionage.
Porre Soldier, What the hell's takin' so long? Where's my food? That's the problem with El Nido people. They're too lazy!
Porre Soldier," Luccia used to work in a lab up in Porre. But she lost her brother in a freak accident during his experiments. She wanted to get away from it all, so she made her way down to El Nido. Our Grobyc is a killing machine being developed at that time."
Porre Soldier, I kinda feel bad for Orcha. He doesn't know he's being used.
Porre Soldier," Whoa! Did you see that!? The cook, Orcha, just transformed into Hell's Cook! He probably has another dirty job to take care of..."
Porre Soldier, Commander Norris is a little too soft. I wish he'd just crack down on those El Nido hicks.
Porre Soldier," My orders are to investigate the sewer system. You can access the sewer system through a hatch in the hallway, but the current's too fast to actually set foot in the sewer. There's a valve that shuts off the water current, but the bridge leading to it is broken."
Porre Soldier," I tried to wake him up, but he won't budge. Well, he's useless anyway."
Porre Soldier," Under investigation, sir. I am sorry, Sir Lynx, but I cannot allow even you to pass."
Porre Soldier, Whoa! I didn't know you could get in from there!
System, Looks like you can push it.
System," There seems to be some trick to opening it. There's a valve. ~~~Tighten it ~~~Open it ~~~Leave it alone It won't tighten anymore. It won't open any further. 'Water Gate' ~~~Read instructions ~~~Look at water gate ~~~Quit The valve is connected to the water gate. Open the valve to open the gate, and tighten it to close the gate."
Man," Hey, man! Open up! Huh? Let me outta here! What the...? I'm innocent, I say! Hmm?"
System, No one's there...
Porre Soldier, How did I end up in here!?
Porre Soldier, Errrr... Didn't expect they'd come from behind me...
Porre Soldier, Commander Norris! I thought you were inside. What is to become of us?
Porre Soldier, Please exit through the gate.
Porre Soldier," Commander! Is the meeting over? Please, by all means... Go on through, sir!"
Acacia Dragoon," Come back soon, everyone... Zzzz... Zzzz..."
Porre Soldier," Commander, will you be leaving? Sir Lynx, will you be leaving?"
Porre Soldier, Commander! Where are you going?
Acacia Dragoon," I'm not sure it was a good idea to come with these people. Well, at least they know how to make a quick getaway. That's what saved me."
System," Jump in the big hole? ~~~Go for it! ~~~Nah, too dangerous"
Man, I'm gettin' kinda bored of having nothing to do... I never knew being bored could be so boring. I wish Nikki's concert would start soon... Or else I'll die of boredom!
Man, Where did that demi- human waitress go? I'm thirsty as hell!
Man," I was really blown away by Nikki's performance... He's a genius... No, that still doesn't give him enough credit. He must have gone through a lot in life to come up with a performance like that..."
Woman, Oh...Nikki... That was a beautiful performance... You moved me to tears...!
Woman," Nikki's concert was more like a broadway musical this time. It was wonderful... How does he come up with these ideas!? Well, I'll be able to enjoy my daily latte now!"
Woman," The long-awaited Nikki concert is over... It felt like an eternity waiting for the concert to start, but once it started, it ended before I knew it. There was something bothering Nikki, though... He looked a little sad... but that really brought out his charm! Anyway, now that the concert's over, how am I going to fill this void in my life? Ohh, Nikki...! Marry me!!!"
Man," Have you guys been to an island called Marbule? It used to be a beautiful island where mermaids lived. But now, it's infested by nasty-lookin' monsters. That island will never be the same..."
Woman," Hey! You're my ultimate rival, Miki! Listen, YOU! You stay away from my Nikki, or you'll be sorry! OH MY GAWD!!! Nikki!!!!!!"
Man," Move it! Move it! Oh, my achin' back..."
Man, Yeah... I guess this will do.
Acacia Dragoon, How's this...?
System, ~~- NO ENTRY -~~ The interior is still under construction.
Man," Hold that for me, will ya?"
Girl," Some swings would be nice, too. Please, Headmaster!?"
Man, Darn... We need more manpower.
System, Go down into the sand boil? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System, Push it towards the sand jet to stop the flow.
System, Push it towards the cliff to stop the sand jet.
Woman, Will that man ever return...? I shall wait...
Porre Soldier, We have orders not to let anyone through. But I believe we will be withdrawing soon.
Porre Soldier," We haven't received official word, but there seems to have been some trouble inside."
Porre Soldier, Commander!? When did you get out?
Porre Soldier, This place is closed down.
Man," Y-You are...! Gosh, I was really surprised to hear about what happened to you. Although you might have some hard times, don't give up! I'll be rooting for you. Oh yeah, I'm closing up shop today, so go ahead and take any of the leftovers. That'll cheer you up! You've received some Viper Churros... They taste better than usual... You feel revitalized! There was something hard inside it... When you look at it closer, you found Rainbow!!!"
Man," Serge...!? ...But you're not the same person who was attacking the town earlier... That guy had cold, sinister eyes, as if he hated everything in the world..."
System, Would you like to rest? ~~~Yes ~~~No
System, Serge received a package for Irenes.
Man," Did you hear!? This time, Sky Dragon Isle has floated up into the sky! What the hell is goin' on!? What's gonna happen to us...?"
Man," Like I told you, they're all taking shelter at the village chief's. I can't let outsiders through. Who knows how long we'll be in this situation? If I were you, I'd try to find a safe place to hide."
Porre Soldier, I saw a mysterious light somewhere out at sea! But I could not confirm what was going on... I saw a mysterious light out at sea... But it's too far away to see what's going on...
Porre Soldier," Commander Norris! Can you tell us what's going on around here? I don't think high command ever anticipated such a situation...! We are not able to conduct any action without orders from high command... Nonetheless, I sense that a very irregular occurence is happening here..."
System, The door won't open.
Man," If we don't pick up the pace, we'll be stuck in the dark. Maybe I should just hire a new worker in town."
Girl," Welcome traveler! I will trade you materials for your extra Elements here. ~~~Trade ~~~Thanks, maybe later ...Oh, that's too bad. We have many kinds of materials you might be interested in. Thank you so much! If you get more unwanted Elements, please come again!"
Man, That must be the 'Terra Tower' that the folk legends referred to... I never thought I would ever see such a legendary tower in my life...
Girl, That's far out... The isle's floating in air! I wonder what's going to happen? How exciting!
Girl," Everyone's going crazy right now! Believe it or not, right after the big earthquake, Sky Dragon Isle flew up into the air! Isn't that absolutely wild!? Unbelievable!!!"
Woman, Truly unbelievable... The Sky Dragon Isle just lifted off the ground! What has caused this catastrophe?
Woman, I don't care if you're the village chief or what. Back of the line!
Girl," Please, Chief... Don't push..."
Man," Ah, excuse me Chief, but I was here first."
Woman," With such a bizarre thing occuring, like the Sky Dragon's island floating in the sky, I'm afraid of what's going to happen next... All that I hope for is a world where my children can live worry-free."
